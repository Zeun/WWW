B000EVS4TY1206576000 positivo Delicious cookie mix I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix. I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix.
B0000DF3IX1127088000 positivo Sweet Paprika: A sweet ingredient! While in Hungary we were given a recipe for Hungarian Goulash. It needs sweet paprika. This was terrific in that dish and others. I will purchase it again when I need more.
B0002QF1LK1138147200 positivo Best Cereal BY FAR Without a doubt, I would recommend this wholesome and sweet cereal treat to anyone. The crunchy o-shaped pieces are filled with crispy rice, graham cracker bits, and infused with delicious honey flavor. "Oh! What a great cereal!"
B0002QF1LK1118016000 positivo Oh! This cereal is so sweet....yet so good for you! One taste=ADDICTION!!!! I just tried this cereal out of curiousity and I was hooked! It is an excellent breakfast choice, or just any time to eat! Especially as breakfast because you will crave more honey taste and you won't be hungry later {probably because of how much you'd eat} and it is actually sweeter and better than Honey Bunches of Oats. Cap'n Crunch Berries is an option, but this splendid cereal is SO FILLED WITH A HONEY-FILLED TASTE! I have not tried much better tasting cereal than this! Oh!
B0002QF1LK1206489600 neutro Oh's what a cereal! (^_^) ...Oh's what a price (O_o) Man I love Oh's cereal. It is really great to the last bite, but the size of the box its so small compared to all the other cereals out there. The price is crazy for such a small box...but oh's is one of the best cereals I have ever ever eaten. It keeps me coming back despite the small box, and crazy price. If you never had it you should try it just once. It is wonderful I give it 3 stars only because of the price and how much food you get. If the portions were more fair even for this price it would be five star gold...
B0002QF1LK1177545600 positivo ITS GOTTA BE THE BEST CEREAL OF ALL TIME And I've tried alot of cereals. This is by far the best.Its like the cereals I used to eat in the 80's, so sweet, yet so filling.I used to slam this cereal before I tried it.Now I'm hooked.
B0002QF1LK1154390400 positivo Yummmmm Oh's has been my favorite cereal as a kid and still is an essential staple of my college diet. It's absolutely f'ing delicious.
B0002QF1LK1215302400 neutro Delicious and Addictive This cereal is great because it tastes so good. You just crave it. But a word of warning: read the label. Last time my husband and I looked, it had saturated fat! All the other cereals in our cabinet did not... hmmmm. Another reviewer noticed this problem too!Also, Amazon's price of $23 is outrageous. It is between $1.99 to $2.50 in our stores.
B0002QF1LK1355961600 positivo Awesome Cereal I have look all over my hometown and no one carries this brand except Walmart (when they have it)...It tastes like Captain Crunch But is made by Quaker Oats and is exceptionally healthy for you.So I get the best of both worlds...Sweet and Crunchy as well as the Healthy aspect of it and not the pure sugar type...Bigger boxes would be nice though. My family has gone though 3 boxes in a matter of 1 week...Keep them coming...Thanks
B0002QF1LK1350691200 positivo 4 of 5 Oh yes. This cereal is delicious. It's O-shaped corn pieces with "good things in the middle", like real oatmeal. This is a Quaker product, after all. The caramel-like taste, which I'd compare to Cap'n Crunch or old school Mr T, Gremlins and Batman cereal, is sweetened with honey, graham (cracker) flour and brown sugar.It's not a good-tasting but a great-tasting cereal, easily one of the best I've ever tried. But; get this; it's too crunchy. No, it wont get soggy in milk, at-least not in any reasonable amount of time, but that's the problem because it makes for a hard chew. If it had the texture and consistency of, say, Cheerios, it'd be perfect.marcellee.com
B0002QF1LK1327795200 positivo Oh where Oh where have my Oh's gone? I was really distraught to go to my local Walmart and see that they stopped carrying my favorite cereal. But as was elated to find that "the site who has everything including a church" made it available to me by the 6-pack. Oh's is an amazing cereal. The one thing i dont like is the box is so small. I get maybe 3 bowls out of the entire box:-(.
B0002QF1LK1235260800 positivo Like fruit loops but much sweeter I tried these on a whim several weeks ago to offset the amount of chocolate I had eaten that week. It was nice and sweet for a few weeks with that first box. But then I tried it again this week and the aftertaste was so strong. The overall texture and layout of each piece is like Fruit Loops but with tons of honey add and less fruit or frosting. One box should be more than enough.
B0002QF1LK1181606400 neutro Yummy This cereal is awesome- but why is it $23, I just bought it at the store for 1.99!?
B0002QF1LK1184112000 positivo Things you must understand about OH's The 5 stars is based on 1)the taste which is amazing and 2) the price which is $1.99.HOWEVER there is much to dislike in OH's. They are NOT healthy, in fact they are the only cereal I've seen made with hydrogenated vegetable oil which is basically margarine. The lard will coat your spoon and roof of your mouth and probably arteries with a white oily film that does not rinse off with water alone. It must be diluted in soap and scrubbed.It is captain crunch shaped in a ring with bits in the middle and somehow sweeter and rougher on your mouth. Oh's virgins WILL have bloody pallates if not careful.
B0000DF3IZ1281312000 positivo Delicious. Adds a fantastic flavor to your cooking. It was fresh when it arrived and affordable.
B0000DF3IZ1174521600 positivo Thanks! It's great to have this spice that I can't find in stores around here - fast delivery and a good price.
B000BRWIBQ1168732800 neutro on order I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait.
B0005ZWCNS1185926400 neutro If it's good enough for Popeye... I always keeps a can of this fine product on me person. You never knows when some palooka wot ain't on the up and square is gonna need to be put in his place. It always leaves ya strong to the finish.
B000PKFZDM1326672000 positivo Thrilled I chose Omaha Steaks Fantastic. I sent it to my mother and her husband for Christmas. They just loved it. If your ever stuck for a gift Omaha Steaks is a great place to look for one.
B0000TU6PA1171065600 positivo You will not find a better tasting butter The Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with the most expensive French butter. I actually prefer Lurpak over expensive brands like Beurre d'Echire, Celes-sur-Belle, or Isigny-Ste-Mere.Lurpak is a true lactic, or cultured, butter, and it is full of flavor. Therefore a warning is in order: once you start using this stuff there is no going back. Land O'Lakes simply will not do anymore and you will be stuck searching for this stuff wherever you go from then on.
B0000TU6PA1288051200 neutro I like kellygold butter better I guess with any cheese or dairy product, different people are going to have different tastes. This butter is slightly closer to tasting like cheese (although it does not taste like cheese) than kellygold butter, imo. Maybe that's why I like kellygold better. Because I don't like the taste of cheese.I'm sort of glad I got this butter to at least compare with kellygold though. I think it is more easily spreadable, and maybe a tad bit "softer" butter than kellygold.Maybe I'll just try ordinary organic american made butter next time.. it's a whole lot cheaper, and see how it compares with premium butters.
B0000TU6PA1197590400 positivo Fantastic Lurpak is far better than any other butter out there. Be glad you can buy it in the USA! Creamy, tasty and just plain good.
B0000TU6PA1277078400 neutro you're cooking with Butter Recently (I think it was their cookie show) ATK voted Lurpak as the #1 butter in their tasting. And unlike Rach Ray who doesn't think twice about recommending the most ludicrous ingredients that cost the most, I have tremendous respect for Chris Kimball because he actually knows what he's talking about.The taste of Lurpak is very similar to Land O' Lakes, which IMO is truly the standard of butter. I have only tried it a few times since I do not have any recipes that call for butter, but I wanted to try Lurpak since it was so highly recommended. On a piece of toast it is fine and it melts very well.It comes in a little block and it is extremely firm (the sign of all fine butter).I am not certain if I will purchase this again since I was not overly impressed with Lurpak and because Land O' Lakes comes packaged much nicer and is a lot less. Nevertheless, Lurpak is still a good butter to try and to use if you have any recipes that call for a high-fat content butter.Anyway I found this at Shop Rite (don't you dare buy this online unless you enjoy paying more than twice the price - it is stold at all grocery stores) for two ninety-nine for 8 ounces (which is the size of 2 Land O' Lakes sticks).Remember, you don't have to spend a lot to be a great cook.
B0000DF3J21281312000 positivo Delicious. Adds a fantastic flavor to your cooking. It was fresh when it arrived and affordable.
B0000DF3J21174521600 positivo Thanks! It's great to have this spice that I can't find in stores around here - fast delivery and a good price.
B0000TU6P01171065600 neutro Real cultured butter of high quality I usually buy the salted version of this butter since I mostly use it for spreading and for that I like the flavor of the salted version better. That being said, there are a number of recipies that call for unsalted butter and then the unsalted Lurpak is as good as you will find.Note that Lurpak is cultured butter (not sweet cream butter like most American brands) and as such it has a deep and rich flavor that no simple sweet cream butter can match. Cultured butter of this kind is produced by fermenting the cream with lactic bacteria that convert sugars to lactic acid before churning the cream into butter.In my opinion, the Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with far more expensive butters. I actually prefer Lurpak over brands like Echire, etc.
B0000TU6P01278115200 negativo Received melted I am sure this is delicious as it had been recommended to me.However, it was completely melted when I received it, thepackage did not state PERISHABLE and the postage was expensive.I would not buy from this particular site again.
B0000TU6P01351123200 positivo My former #1 butter........... ....to be replaced by Plugra.I became a 'butterholic' after tasting free sample of Lurpak at room temp spread on crakers at Wild Oats years ago.I had thought that butter was butter, and this premium stuff was just marketing gimmick, NOT!Ever since lurpak became my regular butter, I started 'testing' other premium butters, so far none ever surpassed lurpak till I tried Plugra at Whole Foods.Lurpak has this smooth, but tangy taste I crave for. It's an excellent butter to use on fancy Eurostyle bread with organic milk on mornings. But it's not a 'cooking' butter, yes one can use lurpak for cooking, but it's really a waste of flavor and such premium price to boot.Eventually I found another premium butter that replaced lurpak, Plugra, made in USA, and cheaper than lurpak, and even more complex and nuanced flavor than lurpak.Even Cook's illustrated declared Plugra a superior butter than lurpak, its former favorite just like it used to be mine.
B0000TU6P01141862400 is support denmark during middle eastern boycott Since the absurd boycott of Danish products in the Middle East over cartoons, it is good for the west and freedom to support Denmark. Their Lurpak butter and Arla cheeses are delicious and available on-line and at many grocery stores in the US. Buy, you'll like!
B0000DF3J01281312000 positivo Delicious. Adds a fantastic flavor to your cooking. It was fresh when it arrived and affordable.

B000HZIKZA1180656000 positivo Cashews are fresh While the cashews are fresh, they are on the lightly salted side. That makes them healthy for you, but my husband prefers more salt. However, Amazon recently ran these for around $4 a pound, including super saver shipping, which made them pretty irrestible.
B0002QF1NI1182816000 positivo I am so glad I found this! At one time this cereal was available in my local stores. However it was discontinued. I searched the internet and finally found "Quaker Oat Bran" here. The cereal is great it is crunchy and holds the crunchiness even after you add the milk. I love the flavor and it helps to control my cholesterol too.
B0002QF1NI1191196800 positivo light, tasty and healthy Great taste, although a higher in calories than some of the other cereals and good in Folic acid and heat healthy.Wonder why it is not available at the local grocery stores?
B0002QF1NI1169424000 positivo Best Cereal for the Entire Family I started eating Quaker Oat Bran 2 years ago because I wanted a cereal that is high in fiber and protein, yet low in sugar. It is so good as a cereal with milk, and it stays crunchy. It also makes a fantastic trail mix with almonds and dried cranberries or other dried fruit. It reminds me a little of Chex cereal or Life cereal, but it is much healthier and substantial. I have not found any cereal I like better. Now my kids love it, too. I can't keep enough of it in the house. And I prefer this cereal to Quaker Oats Squares, which are made of larger squares.
B0002QF1NI1264982400 neutro Wish I could get it locally The one supermarket chain in our area that carries Quaker Essentials Oat Bran cereal closed our local store. We can get it by driving around 60 miles round trip, but that is inconvenient and wasteful of gas.I could substitute another cereal for myself, but my peach-faced lovebird loves it, and so far will accept no substitute. She eats some, and dunks some in her water bowl, then piles it on a perch. The result is a "cereal sculpture." Why she does this, I don't know.I ordered it through an Amazon vendor and received excellent service, but I wish the shipping wasn't so darn expensive.
B000IG7NCY1350432000 negativo Could Easily break a tooth So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor.
B000CDI0PC1293062400 negativo Worth Buying Last time, my first experience with Lacas, I bought their Kenya. This time I tried their Columbian.This is a quality product for a fair price. Buying a five pound bag is a convenience, too. I only buy two of these in a year, and I never run out. Why make 50 trips a year to the grocery store to buy the teensy bag? The product arrives promptly and keeps very well. Hard to go wrong.
B0000DK2WM1093651200 positivo Fresh Asiago Is great! If you are looking for a flavorful substitute for mozzarella this is it. It has a bit of a bite, melts great and adds bunches of flavor in any application. I have sliced it and melted it on grilled chicken sandwiches, have shredded it and blended it with mozzarella and provolone for pizza, and used it in omelets - all with great results. This is a great tasting cheese - not very well known - which once you try you will be a fan of forever!
B000DZLEZW1359331200 positivo Great brand of mints I love this brand but the orange isn't my favorite flavor. I thought I'd give it a try but I wasn't in love.
B0000TU6RI1358380800 positivo Great Jam!! This is truly wonderful gooseberry jam. It is packed with chunks of gooseberries. I highly recommend this product!! It truly met my expectations.
B0000DK2XR1263081600 positivo A mild and lovely version of this cheese I hope Amazon reinstates this (though it is available at Costco, shopping from the computer chair is sooo convenient!); this is my very favorite gorgonzola. Milder than some, it keeps extremely well, and I even substitute it in dishes calling for Stilton... the best!
B000KNHK5K1176595200 neutro Zsweet This sweetener does not seem very sweet to me, but my husband will use it and he won't touch the blue, pink or yellow artificial sweeteners. I've used it in coffee and tea and baking and had pretty good results. I've mixed it with stevia as well. I don't detect any bitterness or soapiness, but it has a somewhat minty effect that is hard to describe. The mintiness is not really a flavor so much as a minty coolness. I find the yellow sweetener's flavor to be much more sugary than zsweet, but I wanted a sweetener that does not use maltodextrin as a filler.
B000KNHK5K1231977600 negativo Better than Stevia As a natural sweetener, this is far superior to Stevia. There's no bitter aftertaste, and when I use it in coffee and tea, it tastes like sugar. HOWEVER, I've baked with it and unlike its claims, it does cause "gastrointestinal distress" for me. Stick to using it in your drinks.Note: ZSweet also sells individual packets that are supposed to have a more intense sweetness. Don't get them. They don't taste like sugar.
B000KNHK5K1267142400 neutro I will stick with the pink or blue packets... Found this on sale and excitedly tried it this morning in my coffee and a fresh fruit and yogurt smoothie. I wasn't pleased with results in the smoothie because it didn't seem to dissolve properly, probably because of the cold. This resulted in my smoothie having a "sandy grit" texture but the taste was okay. It did dissolve properly in the hot coffee and tasted just fine.Maybe an hour or so later my tummy started gurgling and shortly after was my first of MANY mad dashes to the bathroom today. This started with the smoothie at about 8 AM and has continued throughout the day (it is now 4:15 PM). The info about the product states that it does not cause gastrointestinal distress but other reviews support my experience that it certainly does too AND it continues for long after the product has surely been flushed (pun intended) from your body.
B000KNHK5K1174348800 negativo Worse than Stevia. Mild sweeetness - though ultimately tastes like soap - or something reminiscent of soap.
B000CDI0QG1234137600 negativo Expensive 38.39 is a ridiculous price for 12 red bull. especially considering they cost 2.09 in a store.
B000CDI0QG1286323200 negativo Highway Robbery It always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly over-priced items on here. You can bet I'll never buy anything from this vendor, even if it is a great deal.This is a ridiculously high price for Red Bull. On sale in the stores one can find it for $1.50/can. Why would someone pay more than that online? Caveat emptor --- let the buyer beware!
B000HKLNDG1233878400 neutro Paper on "hand decorated" box looks cheap I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It may be "exotic" wood but the paper stuck to the wood is coming off the front left corner and greatly diminishes its beauty. The tea is nice but it's not worth the money, in my opinion. I knew the box wouldn't be hand painted but I thought the craftsman would've done a better job of gluing down the paper.
B000HKLNDG1262563200 neutro I'm glad I didn't pay for it. I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. ALL of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea. I avoid drinking caffein, which green tea contains, so I gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections. The chest is kind of cheap (paper glued over something, as described by another reviewer). It's pretty, but I don't expect it to hold up.
B000HKLNDG1261353600 positivo Boxed teas make a great gift I love this presentation - we have given several as gifts this Holiday season and they have been well received.
B000HKLNDG1233619200 positivo Gave it as a gift I gave this as a gift and was told by the recipient (who loves it) that it was an amazingly beautiful and well-crafted tea chest. I assume the tea is high-quality as well, but if not you can always replace it with your own selection. Five stars.
B000HKLNDG1189036800 positivo Pleasing tea chest The contents are a nice variety that is displayed attractively. The outside of this small chest is painted an attractive olive with a gold scrolling pattern, and has a brass tone clasp. A fine gift choice for the discriminating.
B0004M0GJ41136505600 positivo Good diet cereal This is a good high fiber breakfast cereal with a high protein content. It does contain some sodium, but has a good potassium/sodium ratio. It has some sugar content (evaporated cane juice) and a good flavor. It generally is found in health food sections of larger supermarkets or in health food stores, and is now available on the Internet. My main complaint is that retailers do not generally carry the hot cereal equivalent (which I managed to get my friend Lisa to carry in her health food store).
B0004M0GJ41339891200 positivo The best cereal in terms of nutrition If you are looking for proper nutrition cereal. This one is the best, period. Low sugar and calorie. High fiber and protein. What more can one ask for. Add low fat milk and some frozen fruit and you have a perfect breakfast. I wish I could buy it in bulk.
B0004M0GJ41258588800 positivo Filling, good taste and nutritious This has recently become my staple breakfast cereal. After trying many high on taste low on nutrition cereals, I decided to find one that fits my needs. I am a regular at the gym so I have to watch what I eat. This one is not only high in protein and fiber, but also tastes much better that the other similar cereals with high fiber.It can easily become addictive as it has the right balance between taste and nutrition.The price is affordable too and the product can be easily found in grocery stores.
B0004M0GJ41185408000 positivo Terrific cereal You won't believe how good this "health food" cereal tastes! Not only is it loaded with protein and low in sugar, it has a fabulous crunch that doesn't get soggy. And it's sweet but not too much so. I just bought another six boxes today, because my kids keep eating it up. Highly recommended!
B0004M0GJ41174780800 positivo Fabulous This is the best cereal! It's my favorite by far. It has a good flavor and an excellent crunch. It's high in whole grains (9 different grains!) and protein. It's good in milk or in yogurt. It's also good as an ice cream topping. My kids just call it "crunchies." As in, "Mommy put crunchies in my yogurt." Try grinding it in the blender and mixing the crumbs with natural peanut butter and honey. Make into balls and serve--great for a snack for adults or kids.
B0000DF3M81205798400 positivo good stuff! Because of food allergies....it's been awhile since I've had chicken wings, I received my bbq sauce and immediately made wings with it...YUMMY!! I also did ribs with it, and they turned out perfect. I recommend this bbq sauce, and to anyone with celiac disease...this bbq sauce is the real deal!
B0000DF3M81309305600 positivo Great smokey flavor Good smokey flavor I was very impressed at how quickly this arrived. The cost to ship was twice the price of the product, not happy about that!
B0000DF3M81265846400 positivo Finally ribs with no sugar This BBQ sauce is the bomb! No sugar - wonderful flavor! Made BBQ ribs and they were so enjoyable. Shared them with a friend - they couldn't tell they had no sugar - loved them also. Package comes with recipes - mailed promptly!

B000A3V1H81341619200 positivo Yummers A family member brought this product to St. Martin where we were vacationing. The six of us ate it with a variety of crackers and it was delicious! We finished the whole thing in one sitting. The foi gras is thick but fairly easy to spread as long as you have a sturdy cracker, and it has a delicate flavor that I love. There is a nice layer of fat at the top.
B000A3V1H81347321600 neutro Foie Gras As a California resident who feared the loss of access to Foie Gras mandated in July, I stocked up on Rougie Duck Foie Gras.

Very tasty.
B000A3V1H81351296000 negativo I used to eat it till I found out how it was made diseased yellow pile of tortured meat, that's what it is. I used to eat it... but than I found out how it's made, that's just gross. people are disgusting and will eat raccoon's a* on a stick if it's called a delicacy.
B000A3V1H81340409600 neutro Who eats Fois Gras? So, Amazon, you're back to selling whale meat, fois gras, and other gross foods? What gives? Is it because few American's eat it, or even know what it is? And, it's expensive which helps your bottom line. So, why not take stuff American's don't or are forbidden to eat (remember the ban on whale slaughter is now world wide and it makes your selling of it illlegal). People are becoming more informed on a daily basis, and finding this kind of stuff on Amazon is little less than appalling, much less, law disregarding.
B0000DK2ZS1109894400 positivo How I love Saga...let me count the ways! What a delightful cheese this is. It has the skin and creamy consistency of a Brie, but is veined properly like a Stilton or other blue cheese.A very creamy consistency, with a wonderful mild flavor. Although you have to be careful not to buy an immature cheese - I bought this same wheel once from one of the discount warehouses, and the cheese was much too young, and lacked character - so it is back to speciality cheese shops - or Amazon now for my purchases.The price is very reasonable, since you could spend five dollars on a small wedge of Saga at a typical cheese shop.Try Saga with a slice of ripe pear!
B0000DF3NR1093651200 neutro Highly Aromatic Green, black and white peppercorns grow like tiny grapes on the Piper Nigrum vine. Green peppercorns are picked when under-ripe. White pepper is black pepper which has been soaked to remove the outer husk. Tellicherry peppercorns are the largest black peppercorns.Tellicherry peppercorns are superior to regular store bought peppercorns. Peppercorns are believed to be indigenous to the Malabar Coast of India. They are spicier, enhance the flavor of all your recipes and can take things up a notch. Of course, there are still recipes where you don't want the intensity of Tellicherry peppercorns, but after you taste the freshly ground flavor, it is difficult to go back to using anything else.I find myself grinding the peppercorns over scrambled eggs, mixing it into cheese fillings and flavored butters, mixing it into fillings for Samosas, using it to flavor shrimp dishes, sprinkling it liberally over salads and pasta and using it in nearly every soup recipe. Don't even get me started telling you how good Tellicherry peppercorns are with potatoes, salmon, beef tenderloin and tequila-lime chicken. Yes, I'm in love with the flavor.Make the change and you will never be able to go back to regular ground pepper. You may laugh, but there are some of us who fear the thought of regular pepper. Some have even gone to the extreme of carrying their own "Minimill Peppercorn Grinder." This is a three-inch tall mini-mill from Spices, etc that you can carry with you in a small velvet bag. Yes, I plan to buy one ASAP.Fun Fact: Pink peppercorns are not from the Piper Nigrum vine. They are the dried berries of Baies rose plant grown on the French island of R&egrave;union and make a colorful addition to sauces.If you need a recipe for Tellicherry Peppercorn Steak, just e-mail me from my site.I was first introduced to this peppercorn by a wonderful store called: Zingermans.

White pepper is black pepper which has been soaked to remove the outer husk. Tellicherry peppercorns are the largest black peppercorns.Tellicherry peppercorns are superior to regular store bought peppercorns. Peppercorns are believed to be indigenous to the Malabar Coast of India. They are spicier, enhance the flavor of all your recipes and can take things up a notch. Of course, there are still recipes where you don't want the intensity of Tellicherry peppercorns, but after you taste the freshly ground flavor, it is difficult to go back to using anything else.I find myself grinding the peppercorns over scrambled eggs, mixing it into cheese fillings and flavored butters, mixing it into fillings for Samosas, using it to flavor shrimp dishes, sprinkling it liberally over salads and pasta and using it in nearly every soup recipe. Don't even get me started telling you how good Tellicherry peppercorns are with potatoes, salmon, beef tenderloin and tequila-lime chicken. Yes, I'm in love with the flavor.Make the change and you will never be able to go back to regular ground pepper. You may laugh, but there are some of us who fear the thought of regular pepper.

B0000DK2ZO1109894400 positivo Wonderful Cheese in the Blue family 'Blue Castello, from Tholstrup (maker of fine cheeses since 1893) is a triple-cream, blue-veined cheese with a washed-rind. The surface has a unique combination of blue-green and reddish molds. These molds give Blue Castello its distinct aroma and flavor. It has a delectably rich and buttery taste accented by its tangy blue veins. The mild flavor develops steadily as long as it keeps, but it never becomes strong.'A step up from Saga blue, you are certian to enjoy this cheese!
B0000DK2ZO1335312000 positivo Castello makes the best danish blue out there! This award winning cheese really takes the cake. Castello has never once let me down! Their danish blue is amazing in every recipe that you can add blue cheese to. I've always received nothing but fresh, quality cheese from castello products at my grocery store. It has stayed in my fridge for almost two weeks once, and was still just as good as the day i bought it. Try this spread on crackers with whatever meat you like most, and you will be in heaven. I've found it's also great if you put this in lasagna, not very traditional, but it is very good.
B000IG7NFQ1356048000 neutro WHOLE PECANS EXPECTED; NOT FOUND I was expecting whole pecans. I was disappointed to find nothing but crumbles. I can still use the crumbles on ice cream, but I would have preferred whole pecans
B000P1I8QW1216684800 positivo Excellent Product, Fast Shipping Scott's Cakes contacted me after receiving my previous order. Representative was pleasant, and wanted to know how they could improve. They did what was recommended and my next shipment came on time and without melted chocolate!!!Thank you Scott's Cakes for providing my family with delicious products and excellent customer service!!!
B000F4Y2GY1326585600 neutro Very tasty This has a sort of nutty-cheesy taste that we really enjoy. Try sprinkling it on popcorn -- yummy. I just wish I knew more ways to use this. Would be great if it came with some recipes or examples of ways to use it.
B000F4Y2GY1305417600 neutro cj It has a robust taste and a good topping to macaroni. Good addition for a quick nutritional meal. It does resemble a cheddar cheese flavor without the salty taste.
B000F4Y2GY1354579200 positivo Good in recipe's I bought this because I had a recipe and it is great. I will include this in many of my dishes.
B000F4Y2GY1354320000 positivo Excellent taste!! adds flavor to everything...a little cheesy taste...i'm ordering more! better than the nutritional yeast i found at Whole Foods! try it
B000F4Y2GY1360627200 positivo The best brand of yeast flakes I like the taste of KAL yeast flakes. I've used some other brands. There isn't a huge difference, but these are just a bit better.
B000F4Y2GY1354579200 positivo Tasty and nutritious. Have been enjoying these for years. Good for cooking beans, baking breads, stir frys, etc. This last container was fresh, but not quite as fresh as previous ones.
B000F4Y2GY1355788800 neutro Less filling, tastes great. You know, making people comment when they really don't have much more to add than what they've already said is pointless.
B000HKLNHC1213833600 positivo Subtle flavors are satisfying Nice assortment of black and green teas, some with subtle flavors in a very attractive box. Unlike many flavored teas that can overwhelm the delicate natural tea taste, these aren't overpowering.
B000HKLNHC1221868800 positivo Bently Decorated Exotic Tea Chest This tea set and its box are top-of-the-line. The only thing that almost brought it to four stars was that the decoration in the center of the top of the box was not oriented correctly, being turned, noticibly, to one side. I hope this is not endemic. Other than that, it is the type of tea set that is normally offered at seminars and meetings in 4-5 star hotels but a bit more decorative. I am proud to display this box and its selections of teas for my guests in my home.
B000HKLNHC1212796800 positivo Awesome present for your tea lover This was a great present for my grandmother. She likes tea and this is not only a nice collection of teas, but a beautiful case for her to keep her favorites after she uses the stock ones. The selection duplicates itself in the different sections and does not have 12 different ones, only six, but this is fine. The case holds some very large sections and should hold any teabags unlike the solid brown one that I bought for my mother.I would recommend this product. Grandmother says that the tea is very good too.
B000HKLNHC1250726400 positivo Love it I got this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it everything was there and the box was just as pictures
B000HKLNHC1215475200 negativo Misleading Advertising Hand decorated? Maybe by slave labor in some 3rd world country. I should have read all the reviews more carefully. The only "exotic" thing about this purchase is probably the chemicals used in gluing the cheap paper onto the chest. There are glue splatters all over the top, and scratches on the inside. The paint on the corners looks like it was done by 3rd graders. I purchased this primarily for the chest, and could easily forgive the poor selection in flavors if the chest was worth more than $10. As it stands, I'm going to try to return this to Amazon ASAP.***Very Disappointed*** Read all the reviews before purchasing this!!
B000HKLNHC1215302400 negativo Disappointing This was a very disappointing purchase. The 'Premium Hand Decorated Exotic Wooden Tea Chest' appears to be pine decorated with printed paper. Although the print is very nice, the description of it is a bit overblown.The tea inside was okay. Some of the combinations of flavors just didn't go well together, and often drowned the flavor of the tea.
B000HKLNHC1211846400 negativo Questionable quality The teas are good, don't get me wrong, but the whole reason I purchased this for my wife was because of the box. And the quality of the box is mediocre at best. The corners were worn and the gold trim paint was splattered all over the top of the thing. Yikes!
B000HKLNHC1212019200 negativo False advertising "Hand decorated"...? Only if that phrase means cheap glued-on paper. I, too, purchased this item primarily for the chest. The chest arrived with the paper already peeling from all corners; on the lid are several raggedy-edged holes in full view. Really disappointing. Does anyone from Bentley actually read the advertising copy?
B000HKLNHC1215302400 neutro Nice Gift The tea chest itself is quite pretty. I bought several to give as gifts. There's a nice variety of tea inside and some really good flavors of green tea.The one downside of the chest? That the company pastes a label on the bottom of the chest and it is NOT easily removed. The label covers the entire bottom of the chest. It would be nice if they at least made it so you can remove it without leaving the wood looking worse for wear. I realize a label isn't a big deal; I just prefer to give a gift without the unsightly label.
B000HKLNHC1216166400 neutro Good tea/cheap chest The tea assortment in the chest is excellent, vey tasty. However, the chest is very poorly put together. The applique material does not line up and there are numerous rough edges. Not wht I would want to display on the countertop.
B000HKLNHC1217548800 negativo Just confirming the review already here. Indeed, the tea is okay, the box is a joke. The full price is outrageous for this low quality clumsily decorated cardboard. Consider buying only for the price of tea, say for $15.
B000HKLNHC1211846400 positivo Great tea in a really nice presentation. Bentleys has some of the best teas out there. This box makes a great gift for tea lovers. It has a great variety of green teas (papaya, pomegranate, blueberry, etc.) and each comes individually bagged for freshness. Just steep and enjoy!
B000HKLNHC1219622400 neutro Tea Chest Review - More for the tea than the chest This item is what it mostly says it is. Most of the tea flavors are decent (I especially like the Peach Tea, but dislike the Orange Spice Tea). Recently these Bentley Tea Chests have been on sale at Amazon for quite decent prices. Don't expect too much from the box though. It's a paper covered pine box with a couple of handles and a front catch. It does have a very thin velvet lining inside, but I wouldn't count on the inside box cells to isolate flavors or prevent oxidation, so foil or paper covered tea bags are a must for this tea chest. Overall a decent value if you buy it on a good sale.
B000HKLNHC1210032000 positivo A Great Selection of Flavors in an Attractive Box This is a wonderful assortment of absolutely delicious tea. The tea is full of flavor and aroma. This made a great gift for me and will surely please the tea drinkers in your life as well. The box is also nice and my young daughter has plans to store little trinkets in it once it is empty.
B000GBYZYU1232928000 positivo Luscious and full flavored I am an avid tea and coffee drinker and this is one of my favorites. In only 4 minutes you get a cup of black tea that is well balanced with a pronounced flavor and aroma of vanilla beans. Everytime I make it at home I feel like I am getting high end tea shop tea in my own kitchen. I love that there is enough natural sweetness (and little natural bitterness) that I can enjoy this without any milk or sweetener, unless I really want to. It is a fantastic flavor so much so that I have repeatedly bought this tea despite the price.
B000GBYZYU1276387200 positivo It's vanilla. It's Mighty Leaf. It's delicious! Of course it's a matter of taste, but I'll join the small chorus in singing the praises of this wonderful tea. To date, I have not been disappointed by Mighty Leaf (the Organic Breakfast is another favorite). However, I should issue a warning: If you serve Mighty Leaf Vanilla Bean to guests after dinner, be prepared to pour a second cup!
B000GBYZYU1224374400 positivo Good vanilla flavor - a bit pricey though with the 'special' bags. I think this is the best vanilla tea I have tried. I thought the tea bags made it pretty pricey - so I'll try the loose leaf next time.
B000GBYZYU1201132800 positivo Mellow And Luxurious I loved this tea when I tried it at a restaurant. The tea bag itself is made from a silky, shimmering material not unlike a pair of sexy panties. The flavor of the vanilla is lovely against the black tea. I sent a box to my mother and it arrived quickly and she loved it although she did not mention the tea bags similarities to sexy panties.
B000GBYZYU1358899200 positivo My family really enjoys this tea. I thought I'd try this tea since my son likes vanilla bean black tea. We used it as soon as it arrived. The whole family likes it. It came well packaged. I like the new style teabag which performs well.
B000GBYZYU1353456000 positivo My Favorite! I got interested in this tea after purchasing it from our local Florida grocery chain. It sounded good and it was! When I went back to buy more, they told me that they were not selling it anymore. #$%^&* I really wanted this stuff and when they said they did not have it, I WANTED IT MORE! So I searched other stores with no luck. So good 'ol Amazon saved the day! I ordered it and got it in a couple of days. I am a Happy Camper! Got my tea! hank You Amazon! I will be ordering more!
B000OZP7UE1198195200 neutro Good product - Amazon Screwups Two parts to this review - one for the product and one for Amazon1) I love this turkey pepperoni. Great taste, low calories, and little fat. It's a much healthier product than standard pepperoni. My main complaint is I have had several packages where the pepperonin are encased in mold. I couldn't see any visible holes or slits in the packaging, but the product inside was solid green and grey. This is not Amazon's fault since they just ship a box of 12 that came straight from the manufacturer with all the original labelling etc. One other time, I received only 11 of 12 packages inside the box.2) The product listing is incorrect on this page or Amazon is unable to get it right. It's listed as a pack of 12 6-ounce packages. I have ordered this product numerous times, and Amazon always ships a pack of 12 3-ounce packages. As I said above, the product is in its original packaging from the manufacturer and it clearly says in big bold letters "12 3 oz. packages" right on the box. Amazon then applies their own sticker saying "12 6 oz packages". I have ordered this product 4 different times and each time I only got half an order. To Amazon's credit, they have fixed it everytime (for me) but seem incapable of fixing the problem at the source. Either the website is listing the wrong size or someone in the warehouses can't read or do simple math. I have discussed this with customer service each time, but they still haven't fixed it.So, 4 stars for the product. 4 stars for Amazon always fixing my order in the end. 0 stars for Amazon's ability to correct a simple problem.
B000PDESIC1349136000 positivo Son likes them, but they're rather pungent These have a lot of garlic and onion powder and are rather pungent. My son likes them, though! We both prefer the cheese-flavor over this one. This seems a bit overly spicy/seasoned for babies & toddlers.
B000PDESIC1303430400 negativo Disgusting garlic breath First of all, I have major issues with children's snacks that are so full of sodium.I have to admit, my son loves these. What is not so great is the two or three days of garlic breath I have to endure afterwards. Was it so necessary to add garlic salt to a toddler snack? The onion and other vegetables are more than enough to provide flavour.
B000PDESIC1253577600 positivo Another winner for Gerber My 17 month old daughter loves this crunchies, she has been eating them since she was about 9 months or so. She only likes the veggie dip flavor, and hey I rather give her this than regular potato chips from the store. Great product from Gerber
B000PDESIC1229385600 positivo My daughter loves these!! My 21 month old absolutely loves these. She would eat the whole container if I would let her. I have found most gerber graduate to be great amd she will eat them.

B000IG7NIS1350432000 negativo Could Easily break a tooth So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor.
B000PO51IM1216512000 positivo Perfect gift for Dad or Grandpa! Show dad or grandpa how much you love with them with this fantastic fudge... Order yours today!
B000J5EXZE1283817600 positivo Pretty Good Chai Experience ****Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as "cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice" and "medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated.Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi.Recommended.****
B000PDESJ61201392000 positivo Awesome baby prunes! My daughter loves these! The only thing I wish they would change would be to make the package recyclable.
B000FPGZHW1316390400 positivo Good Product I mash a small piece of fresh banana and mix with a container of this and my daughter eats the whole thing like candy. I like to take these on the go as opposed to the glass jars because I don't have to worry about it breaking inside my bag. If you are vegan you might want to get another brand. There is tuna oil included in the ingredient list which is how the DHA is added.
B000FPGZHW1307836800 negativo added fish oil to this for a BABY?? I am not happy with Gerber at all. I researched their products and they do not have to list ingredients if below a certain percentage. (LIKE IF GREEN BEANS WERE MADE ON A CONVEYER OF WHERE RICE WAS MADE AND THE RICE WAS UNDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT TRACED THEY DO NOT LIST IT ON THE INGREDIENTS). The beans I did not know have fish oil in it. It is now listed on the product ingredients.
B000FPGZHW1304380800 positivo My twins love it! Cheap and good. My twins love it. A little on the watery side, but we always add chopped chicken to go with it, so it works out perfectly.
B000FPGZHW1304035200 positivo my daughter loves this Couldn't find this in any of the stores, so I tried it. My daughter loves it, and becuase it has fruit and vegetables I feel okay giving it for breakfast or dinner. It is a little runny so i usually give it with mixed grain cereal to bulk it up. I would recommend this to anyone with a fussy eater.
B000FPGZHW1303344000 positivo Good, not the best When in doubt my daughter will aways eat sweet potatoes. These are good. Sweet potatoes and water. However, they are a little runny. I think they thin it out more than they should. But it is ok. Ella's is my favorite. They have a nice thick baby food. Earths best is my second favorite followed by Gerber.
B000FPGZHW1293926400 positivo Favorite veggie in an organic version Sweet potatoes is one of my child's favorite vegetables and we just love Gerber. I am so pleased to have found the organic sweet potatoes in this bulk option from Amazon. The price is far better than in the store and I don't have to worry about running out all the time. Everything arrived in perfect shape and the expiration is the same or better than the same stuff in the store.
B000FPGZHW1273708800 positivo Baby food Same baby food as in the store, but delivered right to your door. This is a nice flavor for getting vegetables into a kid who won't ordinarily eat them.
B000FPGZHW1339718400 negativo disappointment with way of packing really disappointment since the way they arrived was horriblei was trying reach them since couple of days no responsei recommend not to go ahead with this product..
B000FPGZHW1342051200 negativo NOT for introductory food The AAP says not to make your own green beans, spinach, squash etc. due to the higher levels of nitrates so I thought this product would be great to introduce green beans to my 6 month old. The product contains FISH OIL, so it is not a suitable candidate for a 6 month old or an introductory food for any age. It is also not returnable.While the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only, the picture of the product says with DHA. The DHA comes from fish oil. After contacting Amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product I thought I was ordering, they refunded my money. They offered to send out a new (replacement) item, but I think I would get the same mislabeled product. While I was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused I think Amazon's customer service did a great job.
B000FPGZHW1337040000 negativo Real ingredients not listed The real ingredients is not listed by amazon. After buying the product, I found that it contains Tuna oil (source of DHA). This should have been mentioned by Amazon, and they are refusing when I requested refund. Disappointed in Amazon customer service for the first time.
B000FPGZHW1350691200 positivo Yummy in the tummy!! These are my baby's FAVORITE foods!!! And my child is a very very very very picky eater (prefers milk over food). A little thin but perfect for 4-6 mo and for the older babies, we thicken it by adding meat or rice cereal. I was very disappointed and frustrated when all 5 of our local stores stopped carrying these. So happy I found them here for my baby! The ppl here who complain about tuna oil added are dumb (no pun intended). They help with baby brain development. It's not super easy to find the organic baby foods you want with DHA added in them (ellas kitchen, plum organic, etc don't have DHA) -- go buy those and quit whining about tuna oil added to The gerber organic green beans bc it's probably folks like you who complained to the stores that make it very difficult for many parents like me to FIND this food in stores! And if the complaining persists, gerber may stop making it all together and babies who love this product will suffer! Gerber, don't stop making these! I would give it 6 stars if I could!I bought 48 containers of gerber organic green beans from Amazon and can't wait to see the smile on her face when we eat these again (she has been w/o these for 3 mo),
B000FPGZHW1296604800 negativo Tuna Oil + Green Beans? = No Thank You! I am very disappointed that Gerber has added DHA to their green beans. My son used to Love his Gerber Organic Green Beans. I (unwittingly) tried feeding him the new formulation with added DHA and he kept refusing it. I did notice that the consistency was different than usual - it had more of a gel like texture to it. And then I read the ingredients and saw that it had added Tuna Oil. !? Today I learned that another of his favorites, Gerber Organic Carrots, now has DHA added to it too. I'm so frustrated! Looks like I'll be making our own baby food now.
B000FPGZHW1357344000 negativo Contains Tuna Oil from tuna from the ocean. NOT ALL THAT COMPLETELY ORGANIC!!! Okay were do I start, how about this may not be a wise source of DHA for your child. Watch a movie called Autism: Made In The USA, so you will know why. The movie is free on YouTube. This baby food product contains the FDA approved amount of mercury, which is in the tuna oil ingredient, in this baby food product. You may not be aware, BUT, mercury never leaves the body, unless you remove it by means of medical treatment removal; look that method up as well. Mercury is not good for your child, no matter the amount, I am a mother and involved in science. Take my advice and try something a lot more organic and mercury free. It will benefit you and your child in the long run.
B000FPGZHW1356480000 positivo Organic Green Beans My grand-daughter loves them What better recommendation than that of the one who consumes them? I highly recommend them on her behalf!
B000FPGZHW1344470400 negativo Yucky Vegetable Smoothie Add-in Gerber changed the recipe for the worse, this version isn't new and improved. It's worse I think because of the addition of the tuna oil/DHA. When the weather cools down I'll hide this in soups and stews as a mystery ingredient. Even the dog won't eat it :(
B000FPGZHW1330992000 positivo Awesome Flavor I used to buy this at my local grocery store but now I cannot find. I love that it is a fruit & veggie combo. My 19 month old daughter usually will not eat veggies but she always likes this one. I will continue to buy it.
B000FPGZHW1327536000 positivo My baby eats it all! I bought These green beans for my baby because they're organic. I honestly expected him to reject them, that it would be a good photo op for funny faces. He didn't flinch and in fact ate the whole thing! This was much to my surprise! Maybe it was a fluke, he was really hungry that day. On a different day, he ate the whole container once again! I'm thrilled that this is another green option in his diet since he doesn't seem crazy about peas. I will be buying more of these.
B000FPGZHW1321920000 positivo Best Flavor for fussy eaters Excellent flavor for difficult eaters. Our 2 yr old son will eat almost nothing except milk. This is one of the only foods he has ever been willing to eat. Hard to find, I wish more stores would stock it. Also wish amazon could get it at a lower price.
B0000DF3SM1168560000 positivo Real Pistachio After trying many other pistachio flavorings and pistachio extracts which all taste very much like almond extract I have finally found the only product that delivers real pistachio flavor. We made the most delicious pistachio marzipan this year for the holidays. We also had a success in making a truffle with pistachio dark chocolate ganache that everyone said hit the mark on its pistachio flavor. Next up is a warm phyllo beggars purse filled with molten chocolate ganache served in a pool of pistachio creme anglaise.
B000JQKEMY1172102400 positivo Cheesecake Paradise The taste was sensational and well liked by my guests. It tastes just like the Frango Mint Chocolates you would purchase at Marshal Fields. The price seems a little high.

B00070PA0S1233964800 negativo Stale, refund requested, but never received The candy we received was not edible. It had long ago expired. We requested a refund, but it never came through. Avoid this vendor.
B000IG7NKQ1350432000 negativo Could Easily break a tooth So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor.
B000K8CPCS1302048000 negativo Made coffe sweet I thought these would just add flavor rather than such a sweet taste. I don't like sugar in my coffee. Now I have 6 containers that I have to throw away. There used to be a product just like this that just added flavor and did not have all of the artificial sweetners. Not a good thing for someone who does not like sugar in their coffee but if you do it is good.
B000K8CPCS1281916800 positivo Flavour Creations Hazelnut Coffee Flavoring Tablets (Pack of 6 48-count Dispensers) I love Nescafe Tasters Choice Hazelnut-flavored instant coffee. However, the 6.1-ounce plastic container of this product is no longer available in any of my local retail stores (although a smaller package of individually portioned coffee containers is, at an exhorbitant price). Further, the best price of the Tasters Choice 6.1-ounce-package hazelnut coffee has increased from about $6.00 (store price) to nearly $57.00 (internet price, including shipping) during the past two years -- representing over a 800 percent price increase! Hence, it is no longer economically feasable for me to purchase this brand coffee. Other brands are either not acceptable for reasons of unacceptable taste or exhorbitant cost.Several years ago I tried hazelnut flavor tablets for my instant coffee and found them to be satisfactory, if not convenient (since there are two ingredients, instead of one, at each preparation).I therefore recently ordered Flavor Creations Hazelnut tablets from Amazon on a trial basis. Because I combined this order with another, Amazon charged no shipping and handling fees.The cost proved to be satisfactory, and the Flavor Creations Hazelnut tablets added to another good, but less expensive, brand of coffee made the total cost far more satisfactory. Further, the flavor was very near my original favorite.I plan to reorder these tablets when I run out, providing the cost has not increased.
B000K8CPCS1263945600 positivo Outstanding Flavor No Calories This is such a great product. So glad Amazon is carrying it ... Great flavor without the calories. I not only add it to my coffee but it's also great added to cake & cookie mixes (Just crush the tablets before adding to the mix) All the flavors taste terrific. LOVE IT!
B000K8CPCS1258934400 positivo flavor coffees tablets I really like this product. It gives a wonderful flavor to my coffee in the morning. What I like most about it is that it's not overpowering. I make a "cup to go" and have it on my way to the gym or work. I've only tried the hazelnut flavoring so far but I'm looking forward to tying the vanilla as well.
B000K8CPCS1304380800 positivo Very Good Flavor. The Hazelnut flavor is very good but could be stronger. I actually add two tablets to a #2 cone filter when brewing coffee. I find this is better than adding the tables to an already brewed cup of coffee.
B000K8CPCS1310774400 neutro Great flavor I used to buy this product in the grocery store and loved it. I could no longer find it locally so I am thrilled to be able to buy it from Amazon.com.
B000K8CPCS1300492800 neutro Works great! I had been looking for the straw type our local store used to carry, and thought I would try these. More convienient and works as good.
B000K8CPCS1293667200 neutro Been using for years, carry in my purse My husband and I have used this product for years, carry them in my purse and have them at home. Can't remember the last time I had a cup of coffee that wasn't Hazelnut flavored.
B000K8CPCS1289433600 positivo flovor creations I have used this product for a while when I was up north. When I came back home to florida I could not find a store that carried it. I went on line andfound it thru Amazon. delivery time was fast and the price was right.
B000K8CPCS1265155200 positivo convenient These are the most convenient coffee creamers I have ever found. No more messy powder packets that could pop open and ruin my purse. I loved these from the first day I saw them. They are a blessing for traveling. Now it doesn't matter what flavor coffee establishments have, I can make it be the flavor I want.
B000K8CPCS1264723200 positivo addicted... i actually call this my 'coffee crack' because i can't drink coffee without it anymore. my local grocery stopped carrying it, so glad amazon has it!
B000K8CPCS1259539200 positivo Taste Great This is really nice to have when you just want something a little different. It makes drinking a cup of coffee step out of the ordinary.
B000K8CPCS1253923200 neutro coffee flavoring This is a simple, easy to use way to add flavoring to coffee when you wish without adding calories.
B000K8CPCS1361750400 neutro Yummy Coffee These little tablets do the trick to change my standard warehouse store coffee into the yummy hazelnut flavor I like. Ido nee to use two per mug to get the flavor I like.
B000K8CPCS1359158400 positivo a great coffee flavorer a friend intro. to this product and liked it so much i had to buy some.if you like coffee you'll love this product
B000K8CPCS1355184000 positivo Don't want coffe without this! I discovered this product a few years ago. Now I can enjoy the Hazelnut flavor without having to brew a whole pot.
B000K8CPCS1353801600 positivo I Luv Hazelnut I love hazelnut flavored coffee but it isn't available everywhere. These tablets are great. I carry them in my purse and I can have my favorite flavor ant time!
B000K8CPCS1350518400 positivo Nice product This is a nice product. It doesn't perfectly flavor coffee, but it does add a nice little touch. Definitely worth 4 stars.
B000K8CPCS1335657600 positivo A second purchase for me I never knew there was any flavoring like this until I saw it listed here at Amazon. I love these tablets and carry a tin with me in my purse (no larger than a tin of mints) so that I can have Hazelnut coffee when I am out. I also use these when I only want one cup of decaf coffee and make instant coffee. I like the flavor tablets because it doesn't diminish the coffee taste, dissolves easily and has very little sweetness to them. I can add Splenda easily. It is getting harder and harder to find Hazelnut coffee for a regular coffee pot or in instant form. The recommendations are for using one tablet but I always use two. If I am going to make iced coffee I have an extra large mug that I use and use three tablets instead.I was so pleased to find these on Amazon.
B000K8CPCS1302480000 positivo Gad Zuks, Batman! No calories, no carbs, just great taste to add to coffee anywhere you are. I keep it in my purse. This stuff is great!
B000K8CPCS1261440000 positivo A little disappointed I think something must have happened to the products prior to shipment because there was dust everywhere (dust from the tablets). But, they still taste fine.
B00020HV1E1357948800 positivo Love KAL yeast KAL nutritional yeast is my favorite brand of the various brands I've tried. It has a nice &#34;cheesy&#34; flavor, a bit stronger than Red Star brand in my opinion. I also like the fact that it is sold in large canisters. I will continue to buy as long as I can still find it!
B00020HV1E1357603200 neutro Exact product I use at a great value I used to buy this at Whole Foods but they were frequently out of the large size. This is a much better price and I can get it any time I need it.
B00020HV1E1357430400 positivo yum! sprinkle on vegan hot food I add this to tofu stir fries and places id put cheese, like a bked portabello mushroom. Very worthy supplement for that b12 we need to find and the taste as an addition is super.
B00020HV1E1356739200 positivo Tasty and full of nutrients: great for vegans. I eat no meat and minimal animal products which makes getting all of the needed protein and nutrients a bit difficult in some ways. Nutritional Yeast goes a long way in helping with that. It has a nice cheesy, nutty flavor which is fantastic on pasta, in soup, and lots of other foods. Adding a few tablespoons to a bowl of soup adds a nice flavor and creaminess that I love and find hard to achieve usually since I don't use milk products. On pasta, it creates a nice &#34;mac and cheese&#34; and is a good replacement for parmesan on spaghetti. If I'm in a hurry in the morning, it's super easy to sprinkle some on toast. It is easy to create a sauce with just some of these flakes and some soy milk or water (along with other spices depending on your taste), which can be added to steamed vegetables, rice, or any number of other foods. Delicious.I definitely recommend these for anyone struggling to incorporate enough nutrients and protein into their diet, or anyone who just wants to make what they already eat even better nutritionally. I can't compare the KAL Yeast Flakes to other brands because this is the only one I've tried, but that should say something: I haven't found the need to even try any others, because these ones are great.
B00020HV1E1356652800 positivo Great nutritional yeast! I have purchased this product for the past year, and I love it. It does exactly what nutritional yeast is supposed to do - give things that &#34;cheezy&#34; flavor and bulk. I use it for many things, though of course, it is showcased in my favorite &#34;cheezy sauce&#34; that we serve on our vegan macaroni.I particularly like the packaging - the cylinder shape is reminiscent of oatmeal bought in stores . . . but it is easy to grab and unlike the bags of nutritional yeast, I have yet to spill this accidentally.
B00020HV1E1356393600 positivo It meets my needs I take KAL - Yeast Flakes as one of the supplements in my cardio nutrition program. I like that it comes as flakes. That way it's easier to acccurately measure each amount in my morning smoothie.
B00020HV1E1352764800 positivo Love this product! It has been years since I've used nutritional yeast. Based on the reviews, I decided to give this product a shot and I'm glad I did. While I'm not going to tell you that it tastes just like cheese, it's very unique flavor is quite palatable and most enjoyable. My favorite use for KAL's yeast flakes is to mix it in water, sometimes adding a little olive oil, and to put it on steamed veggies. Major yum!
B00020HV1E1349222400 positivo yeast flakes awesome product,for the price ,good way to get a lot of vita.I love it on popcorn tastes like butter! good deal ya
B00020HV1E1348617600 positivo Great for adding flavor and vitamins to food! We use this on almost everything. It works great with Tofu, and also makes a very tasty and creamy pot pie when mixed with vegetables. The nutritional content makes it ideal for not just Vegans and Vegetarians, but all people who are looking to add flavor and remain health conscious.A very simple recipe that I use on a regular basis is to cut Firm Tofu into halves or quarters, squeeze the water out as much as possible. I then coat with Braggs Amino Acids, and yeast flakes. This gives it a very good texture and taste.
B00020HV1E1347408000 positivo Wonderful Product. This is a great value for the amount you get. The yeast is fresh tasting and delicious. I would recommend.
B00020HV1E1325462400 positivo Yum These flakes are a delicious addition to a lot of dishes. I initially got them for a healthy addition to soups. It adds a lot of savory, slightly cheese like flavor. I'll occasionally sprinkle some on meats or eggs I'm cooking in the pan. It's a little bit like using grated parmesean. It has a ton of B vitamins, so good for energy and a lot of other health benefits. I had never even heard of using this in cooking but I was pleasantly surprised and will be getting more. The canister is huge and should last a long time, even with me dumping the flakes on pretty liberally.
B00020HV1E1322524800 positivo Sooooo good Great tasting "nooch"! :) Loved it and love the big container size, much more economical buying it in bulk like this.
B00020HV1E1307145600 positivo Love it love it love it!! This product is absolutely fantastic. I first learned about it on a Dr. Oz show, where its health benefits were touted and highly recommended. The taste is delicious -- I mix it in with virtually everything daily, including soups, vegetable dishes, chicken/fish dishes -- you name it! It is also fantastic sprinkled on a baked potato or roasted squash. It makes everything taste rich and cheesy. Without question, I am enjoying a very noticeable increase in physical energy and mental clarity since using this product. After just a couple days of use, I immediately reordered a large supply. This will remain a permanent fixture in my daily diet. I just wish I had known about it sooner!
B00020HV1E1296950400 positivo Yummy & EXTREMELY Healthy My daughter has a severe milk allergy. I purchased this product in hopes of using it to cook a wider variety of meals for our family to enjoy. She is 4 and LOVES the taste of these "cheese flakes". We add it to nearly everything we eat and use it along with garlic/onion powder to make an AMAZING dairy free cheese sauce for mac 'n cheese. It is so healthy for you that I add it to juice to enjoy as a post-workout drink! I will be purchasing this product again and again.
B00020HV1E1295395200 positivo Great taste!! Why didn't I discover this product sooner? I've been using the powdered form of nutritional yeast and it's nowhere the same in terms of texture and taste when added to food. I add this to the traditional Mac and Cheese for the little ones. It adds nutrition AND a cheesier taste/texture and they love it. And how can a parent not love a product that provides the benefits of added nutrition and great taste for the kids?
B00020HV1E1323129600 neutro Decent Option These flakes (often powdery) are better priced (even when ~$15 for 22 oz) than anything available near the metropolitan area where I live. Used to pour this on everything possible before I got sick of the taste, now I sprinkle for a hint of cheesy taste and B12/nutrition.
B00020HV1E1275350400 positivo love these flakes they are delicious and make sooooooo many recipes taste better. the smell is amazing. put on tofu patties with wholewheat flour, you will love it. add to sauces, kinda has a cheese vibe.
B00020HV1E1249516800 positivo Great Tasting Yeast Flakes We use Brewers Yeast for added flavor/texture on popcorn and other foods. Kal is the BEST tasting yeast flakes that we have found and the entire family loves it including our two young children. Best of all, it's low fat and very high in important nutrients. We can't seem to get enough of this stuff.
B00020HV1E1360713600 positivo Good Product I bought those yeast flakes a couple of weeks ago and love to sprinkle it over dishes like noodles, soups and even salads. Great taste! Will buy it again!
B00020HV1E1356480000 positivo Finger nails have improved! I used to have really brittle fingernails that split and I could never keep my nails very long. No problem anymore! I will admit that when I first opened this package I thought this was the worst smelling substance ever but since I recently went no dairy and there are limited cheese substitutes out there and I also knew this was very nutritious (vit Bs, protein and fiber), I bit my lip and sprinkled it on my popcorn. OMG! By the end of that bowl I was licking my fingers! I am completely in LOVE and will have to buy another of these soon as this 22 oz container is running low after just a couple months! lol I would still describe the odor as 'icky' but it oddly makes my mouth water now. Besides you can't smell it much when it's sprinkled over popcorn or on a sandwich or mixed into a soup broth. But the most amazing thing is after less than 2 weeks of eating this (hard to say how much but maybe 2-3 tablespoons daily?) my fingernails became strong and they do not split horizontally like they used to. Love love love love love Nooch &#60;3
B00020HV1E1355702400 positivo Better than I expected Pros:*full of stuff that's good for vegetarians/vegans/picky eaters*dissolves easily*not overly bitter, like other brands I've hadCons:*flavor still discernible in just about everything except very strong miso soup*somewhat expensive, though the volume of the container leads me to believe that this will last quite a while, even if consumed on a daily basisI've tried it in popcorn and soups, and laced my dogs' homemade food with it (picky little chihuahua mixes)--they didn't seem to mind the flavor at all.What it boils down to: if you need it, buy it. This is as good or better than other brands I've tried.
B00020HV1E1354665600 positivo Makes me feel younger and more energetic Great on any food that has a salty taste. I don't recommend on cereal or sweet things like in shakes.
B00020HV1E1353974400 positivo Good stuff I put this on all my salads and baked kale. Tastes great.. kind of like cheese. Good source of aminos and b's
B00020HV1E1353283200 neutro Better than buying bulk My first purchase of this product was from a local health food store which sells it loose in bins. I bought it as a vegan source of vitamin B12. The taste was ok but not something I would use as a flavoring agent. My Amazon purchase of the 22 oz. container was much fresher tasting so that now we also use it to enhance the taste of pasta and gravy. I add it to my oatmeal each morning and it does seem to increase my energy level throughout the day.
B00020HV1E1353196800 positivo Nice Little Flakes I add these flakes to home-made cat food. The cats like it. I think it's supposed to be source of vitamin B for them, which is needed because I cook their meat.
B00020HV1E1352764800 positivo Nutritiously tasty Good taste and nutrition value. Each day I add a spoon to my milk mug, my 2 yr-old kid also like it.
B00020HV1E1350518400 positivo Large! Ordered through Amazon prime. Item arrived on time in perfect condition.You may not realize this product is HUGE! It's nearly the size of a container of oatmeal! VERY reasonable for the price, especially considering how much this stuff costs in a small spice container from whole foods.This is my first experience with nutritional yeast. The taste by itself kind of reminds me of those mystery fried chips you get at fairs sometimes.The product was sealed and even I could tell it was very fresh.I'd buy again.
B00020HV1E1349308800 positivo great product! First off, this is a Huuuuge container! Bigger than I was expecting (about the size of a canister of oatmeal). Second, but most important, this nutritional yeast if yummy!! I had been buying in bulk at Whole Foods, but in my opinion this brand is better. Is is so fresh that the taste is better and the texture is awesome, almost with a little crunch to it, something that the other kind I used never had. Would definitely recommend it for sprinkling on veggies, popcorn, or using for all those yummy vegan "cheese" recipes.
B00020HV1E1349049600 positivo LOVE this stuff! I haven't tried any other brands, but I'm glad to have gotten this one. I'm on my 2nd canister; it lasts a long time. I add it to scrambled eggs and sprinkle it on other foods when it seems like it might work. My favorite way to use it is to air pop some corn (I have a microwave popper in which I use a little olive oil), spritz the popcorn with oil olive when it's ready and sprinkle on a little salt and yeast flakes. Yummy! Now I can't imagine eating it any other way.
B00020HV1E1338422400 positivo First timer and loving it! This is the first time I've tried nutritional yeast. I guess I went all in with the 22oz can (it's a LOT), but I'm happy to say I really like it. I LOVE it on popcorn and my pups are crazy for it on their dog food (it's apparently is good for them too). So, it's a win win!
B00020HV1E1230336000 positivo Healthy Cheesy Flavor For Raw Vegans I'm a raw vegan who sometimes misses the taste and texture of cheese. I'm really glad I bought nutritional yeast flakes because I can add it to all my raw vegan dishes for added flavor and texture. It makes everything taste cheesy and rich, and it's super nutritious and very affordable. A little goes a long way. I can make raw zucchini taste like macaroni and cheese! I can't wait to make cheesy kale chips in my dehydrator. I have had them before and they taste just like cheezits (but they are raw, green and healthy!)I know I'm getting my B vitamins when I consume nutritional yeast because it makes my pee bright yellow.
B00020HV1E1145059200 positivo The Best! This is the best nutritional yeast I've been able to find. It actually tastes good! The ingredients list on Amazon is wrong - its a very good source of B-Vitamins, and many other nutrients, including the important trace minerals Selenium and Chromium. If you're looking for a good yeast powder, this is the one!
B00020HV1E1285200000 neutro Weight loss, energy boost, cat supplement EDIT: A stray kitten came to us with Eosinophilic Granulomas (rodent ulcers or rodent mouth) Took three vets until we found out what was wrong. It was after repeated outbreaks of the lip sores this autoimmune disease causes that I began using Kal yeast in lieu of prednisone and clindamycin. He has been symptom free since, except for one time (last week)when stress triggered it after he escaped outside and became panicked. But after a few days of eating the yeast (in his food), he cleared up - and faster than the medical treatments we used before. I use about 1 T. per 5.5 oz. can. The best part is that he prefers his food with Kal yeast.First discovered this brand in 1978. Occasionally tried others, to my dismay. This one tastes great, I just grab a spoonful and enjoy eating it dry. Seems to give me an immediate lift that way, along with satisfying the type of "hunger" that drives me to eat high calorie snacks. Add it to my cats' canned food, too; we all like Kal Yeast Flakes!Local stores charge almost as much for the smaller size, and other web sites charge a higher price or much higher shipping. Wonderful that I can get this through Amazon! Otherwise, I'd be huffing and puffing up the hill to the local store to pay more.
B00020HV1E1294790400 neutro So Much Better Than the Dregs From the Bulk Bin This nutritional yeast is the same stuff that you can find in the bulk bins at many health food stores. The upside is that it hasn't been pawed through by a zillion shoppers before you and the canister that it comes in is so much sturdier and easier to store in your pantry than the flimsy plastic bags found in most bulk food aisles.The reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is that it is the "small flake" nutritional yeast instead of the "large flake" that I prefer. Plus, although it has a good "cheesy" flavor and is great for using when making vegan dishes or as a topping for popcorn, it does have a very slightly bitter flavor to it that in my experience, some other brands of nutritional yeast don't seem to have.
B00020HV1E1266278400 positivo Delicious and oh so good for you I love Kal Nutritional Yeast. It has a delicious nutty flavor, and I put it on brown rice, salad and mochi. It is especially good mixed with flax borage oil. My cats are addicted to it, and I sprinkle it on their food as well. It is rich in B vitamins and about a gazillion amino acids. I always get the blue label, and at this price it was a tremendous bargain. I bought it online because for some reason New York City was out of it. Go figure, I guess the secret is out!
B00020HV1E1255564800 positivo Kal Yeast makes for a great breakfast Blends very easily. Has a mild taste. I put a scoop of nutritional yeast in my breakfast blender shakes (also has water, powdered milk and frozen berries or other fruit, and a sweetener such as stevia). Gives a great nutritional boost - and all those B vitamins are great for the "nerves' before a work day begins and I like the protein in it too. Have been taking yeast for 20 years - it did take a few weeks to get used to the taste when I began, since I only stirred it in milk. With the fruit and a little sweetener - it tastes really good.
B00020HV1E1324684800 neutro I'll have this with my "Nutritional Sugar Cookies" When I saw the hefty vitamin content, I was at first cautiously pleased. Then I noticed the ingredient list. Most of the big % of RDA numbers (B vitamins) weren't in the yeast naturally. They were, essentially, the result of someone adding the equivalent of a few crushed up B-complex vitamins. Well, that's unfortunate. If I wanted a vitamin B complex tablet, I would just take one.What's more, some of the B vitamins (e.g., folic acid and B6) are of the variety that you may want to be careful not to oversupplement. I doubt the amount added to the yeast would actually create a problem (B6 and folic acid "overdoses" don't really make the news much), but I wanted healthy food here, not food plus extra synthetic (I presume) stuff that I hadn't planned on -- even if most people would argue that the addition is innocuous.Maybe most (or all?) nutritional yeast is this way -- I don't know;I'm no expert on the subject -- but this addition wasn't what I expected and it wasn't what I wanted. In sum, the nutritional yeast is reasonably tasty and I suppose I'll finish it at some point, but in the meantime I'll be looking for one that doesn't have the extra "fortification."
B00020HV1E1320278400 positivo This is the real thing. I bought the 22oz size, and it's bigger than I expected...like the size of one of those round oatmeal containers...5.25" diameter, and 8.5" high.Taste is excellent. And the price can't be beat. That alone would make this a five-star item, but it gets even better.This product is allergen-free (that means NO wheat, corn, milk, egg, soy, gluten, sucrose, animal derivatives, artificial colors, starch, or preservatives). And it is even fortified with extra B-vitamins, Folic Acid, and B-12. Three tablespoons contains 150% of the RDA of B-12!
B00020HV1E1275523200 positivo A very good product, better than expected A very pleasant tasting yeast product. I have used it in several recipes, and it has enhanced and not detracted from the flavor of the recipe. It is chock full of B-vitamins, and much better flavor than some other B-Vitamin products I have used like Marmite. You must sprinkle some on freshly popped popcorn...it is has a naturally cheesy flavor that makes popcorn great.
B00020HV1E1327017600 neutro Good tasting nutritional yeast with lots of folic acid reinforcement. This yeast tastes better than some. The product has high folic acid reinforcement, five times the recommended total daily allowance in each serving according to the product label as of late 2011. This extra folic acid might be a good thing, might be too much of a good thing, might be a bad thing, or might not make any difference to health. A popular-press medical negative alarm around the year 2010 over the issue of too much folic acid in the diet, or too high a RBC folate level in the blood, I'm not sure which, may have been misleading and both Dr. Kelly Robinson of California and Chris A., a health care professional of Maine say in the comments below, comments posted to an earlier version of this customer review, if I understand correctly, to not worry much if at all about negative health effects of high levels of folic acid in food.
B00020HV1E1344988800 positivo Fortified yeast at a great price This is a fortified yeast that tastes great and the cost is very reasonable. Good enough to sprinkle on every dinner!
B00020HV1E1344816000 positivo Kids like it.. I recently bought this item for my daughter who is allergic to Dairy and eggs. She is a vegetarian and I am concerned about her not getting enough vitamin B. So I bought this product for her. My daughter likes her macaroni with this product (replacing the cheese). My son who is not allergic to dairy also loves this product. He always want to replace cheese with this product in his macaroni. I have no means to know, if this will provide enough vitamin-B's. I give it five stars, since my kids liked it.
B00020HV1E1344297600 positivo A quality product. We have been using this product for some time as a cheese substitute on our 'whole foods' based lifestyle. We find this to be an economical and consistently high quality product.
B00020HV1E1340496000 positivo huge The largest container I ever recieved from this Amazon. Ussully I am disappointed on the size of things. I give it to the animals so I don't know about freshness.
B00020HV1E1318896000 positivo yeast flakes Just what I wanted came quickly. Highly recommend both this product and the supplier. Very satisfied. Only need 3 more words... Thanks!
B00020HV1E1316995200 positivo Cheesy is a stretch, but it's a good product My son is on a severely restricted allergy diet and this has a ton of nutrients. I do notice I feel better after I eat this. But, anyone who says this can pass for cheese hasn't actually eaten cheese in many, many years! My son won't eat it if he knows it's in there, but I can mix it with brown rice pasta in small amounts and he doesn't notice it. I like the taste, but again, in smaller quantities
B00020HV1E1313971200 positivo Deliciously Cheesy! I've tried many different brands of nutritional yeast flakes, and these are by and far my favorite! Thank you KAL for such a superior tasting product!
B00020HV1E1300665600 positivo good product Arrived quickly. Good packaging. Very quality product. No complaints. Very convenient to buy this product on line as it can be difficult to find in stores.
B00020HV1E1343865600 positivo delicious Tastes great. Has a little crunch. Feels healthy. Turns pee bright yellow.My only complaint, and this is minor, is that the container was about 60% full when we opened it. They could use a smaller container.Still, it's the best deal I could find.
B00020HV1E1315440000 positivo Great Product Took a little longer to get here this time but, none the less, it showed up in perfect condition. Thanks!
B00020HV1E1360540800 negativo I can't use this in place of parmesan cheese The taste is not what I expected - I expected it to taste good and I didn't like the flavor. I mixed it with pesto because I normally use parmesan. It ruined the pesto. Not a big fan of it as a cheese replacement, however, I'm using it as a nutritional supplement for home-made bread - the flavor doesn't come out in the bread. So for nutrition it's good, but not so good for taste.
B00020HV1E1349308800 neutro KAL Nutritional Yeast I am not a vegetarian, but was looking for a natural way to get more B vitamins into my diet. The noted serving is 3 heaping tablespoons, but I have reduced this to one, as I found the flavor to be very overpowering. But even at one tablespoon it is increasing my vitamin intake considerably. I prefer to taste the food that I am eating and not just the toppings that I put on, so I am experimenting with each meal by putting a spoonful on my plate and dipping my food into it rather than just sprinkling it over everything. I feel this is a good alternative to taking another vitamin pill.
B00020HV1E1302307200 positivo Impressed I'm a vegetarian and had never heard of nutritional yeast. I found it in an online recipe for tofu bacon, and purchased it for that purpose. Some people say it has a nutty or cheesy flavor... To me it has a meaty flavor, but I can see the "cheesy part". I haven't tried any other brands of nutritional yeast, for whatever it's worth. That said, this definitely added a LOT of flavor to the tofu bacon. The end result of the recipe wouldn't exactly be something I would call "bacon", but it was really, really good in its own right. After refrying up some of the leftovers (which had a chance for the flavors to sit), I got the distinct impression that I was eating slices of pork roast. A lot of that I attribute to the nutritional yeast. Part of the reason this stuff is so good is that it contains a LOT of glutamic acid. This amino acid is of course present in MSG, among many other completely natural, healthy things. Do I feel like I'm being naughty by adding this to things? Not really. It tastes good, and it has nutritional value (a complete protein I believe?) for a vegetarian.
B00020HV1E1337731200 neutro Ok yeast flakes We, the family is not vegetarian but I thought we could use the natural vitamins that brewers yeast contain. It is hard for me to add it to finished food and even harder for me to remember to add it to the cooking stage. The taste and texture is very distinct and hard to disguise with traditional foods and taste.
B00020HV1E1333152000 negativo Yeast Flakes Not sure what all to do with these...not working that well on popcorn...surely does not taste like a cheese substitute. Did not dissolve in hot water yet to use as a broth or drink...maybe that is the way to go but so far, not impressed and will probably NOT buy again.
B00020HV1E1317859200 neutro wish I had bought the small can I really wanted to like this, but it is just not something I seem to be able to adjust my taste buds to. I had read reviews other omnivores liked it, and it wasn't just for vegans or vegetarians, so thought it would be better than it is. The quality of the product seems fine - even flakes and nice color, but oh, the taste is something that ruins oatmeal or anything else I've tried it in.
B00020HV1E1361491200 positivo Love it Far superior taste to what I've been buying in bulk at my local health food store. I'm a loyal Kal user now!
B00020HV1E1361232000 positivo Wrong Picture, Great Product. Though the item that arrived was not this picture, it is the same 22 oz KAL Nutritional Yeast flakes I purchased before and I'm very satisfied. It takes a little while to get used to the taste but now I put it on pretty much everything. I agree it's slightly cheesy, a little salty tasting (to me), but I really do sprinkle it on pretty much everything savory or spicy. 3 TBS for 9 protein and it's just yummy. Great product, have purchased again, will purchase again.
B00020HV1E1360713600 positivo best price this stuff is amazing it tastes like cheez itz but no flour or cheese and junk chemicals i can eat this alone or perfect on popcorn and avocados
B00020HV1E1360540800 positivo Nutty flavor Thanks to nutritionist Kimberly Snyder's book The Beauty Detox Solution, I changed the way I eat. In her book, she recommends substituting cheese for Yeast Flakes. Expecting a cheesy flavor, I was surprised that this is more of a nutty flavor. I read all of the reviews so I knew the expect this. I love putting this on my salad and have no complaints that it doesn't exactly taste like cheese. I will add it to my popcorn next time just to see how the flavor will taste then but for now, I'm 100% satisfied with the quality and taste of these yeast flakes.
B00020HV1E1360540800 positivo KAL this has helped my grandmother tramendusly for hereyeast infections and also lowered her cholesterol levels taking this once a day.
B00020HV1E1359849600 positivo Great! Excellent tasting. Be advised though - this is a LOT of yeast. If you can't consume it within a couple of months, the taste starts to diminish.
B00020HV1E1359676800 positivo Bulk size rocks Keep a small shaker flip top canister (I use the Red Star one) so you can refill when needed. Getting this jumbo size will save you a bundle, especially if you use a lot of yeast. The quality is good, and you can add it to many foods to increase nutritional value.
B00020HV1E1359244800 positivo Very tasty I use these flakes in soups, sauces, and broths. The flavor is great and it smells like fresh baked bread. They dissolve very well.
B00020HV1E1358294400 neutro Vegan cooking This is another of those items you would not run across unless you have vegans in the family. This is a substitute for cheese. It has a wonderful flavor for making cheese dips. Even works to sprinkle on pasta dishes.
B00020HV1E1358121600 positivo Good product that is hard to find I have a hard time finding nutritional yeast flakes near me, so buying these online is very convenient. This product works well in my cheese sauces and the price seems fair compared to a local health food store.
B00020HV1E1329955200 positivo Great Vegan Staple I will typically use Bob's Red Mill brand for my pantry items, but I decided to give this a try due to the better value. I have used this now in many recipes and the quality is every bit as good as Bob's. Nutritional Yeast is great for vegan 'cheese' sauces and is an ingredient in many vegan recipes to add nutritional value. I use this for vegan mac-n-cheese and it tastes great!
B00020HV1E1303689600 positivo Great taste and price My girlfriend and I love this stuff. She puts some on her salad every day. We use it with ground sesame seed 50/50 as a topping in place of parmesan and for popcorn. The best use of it so far though is for delicious cheese sauces. We make up about a quart and a half of cheese sauce by using a cup and a half of this with tofu, oil, garlic powder, soy sauce and paprika. Pour it over a pound of cooked noodles like macaroni and bake it for a while and you have rich mac and "cheese".When I'm eating lots of this Nutritional yeast I notice feeling more energetic. It's loaded with B vitamins and protein.Check vegweb for the actual recipe. I think it's "Best mac and cheese in the world, seriously" or something like that. I also use it for a breakfast scramble. Just fry up the potatoes, onions, peppers and whatever you want, then pour on some sauce and let it cook down for a minute or two. Delicious!Some people find something a bit funny about the taste of Nutritional Yeast. But like most things, if you don't go in with an expectation of how it should taste (many people are expecting cheese), you may really like it. I find that it's a more pungent style of cheese like flavor like a sharp cheddar.The KAL brand is excellent also. It's essentially the same strain of yeast that is sold under other labels. Red Star Nutitional Yeast 40240 "vegetarian support formula" from what I've gathered. Which is usually considered the best tasting variety.
B00020HV1E1292112000 positivo Very Tasty Yum, a good brand of yeast. Happy to be able to get this online, I live in a rural area where no one has ever heard of this stuff.
B00020HV1E1287878400 positivo Excellent Item Nutritional Yeast is one of the absolute essentials of a Vegan lifestyle, in my opinion. This product provides that excellent, nutty, cheesy flavor in a great size package. I will be buying again!
B00020HV1E1272326400 positivo Outstanding product, outstanding service! My order was delivered super quick and the product is awesome. The taste is yummy!
B00020HV1E1276214400 positivo Perfect on popcorn! Healthy for you! It's difficult to find flakes of yeast. I like it on home-made popcorn fresh off the stove.It adds a buttery taste to it, and the flakes catch in the crooks and crevices of the popped corn.Discovered it in Portland, OR at an art theater downtown, where they had it in a shaker, next toparmesean cheese and salt, etc.About once a month I HAD to go to that theater, no matter what movie was showing,and have some popcorn with brewer's yeast on it. Finally figured out it was right beforemy menstral cycle, and my body craved B vitamins, which this stuff is packed full of.This is a big container of it, and should last quite a while.I'll tell you, finding FLAKED brewer's years is difficult way down here in my area.
B00020HV1E1354060800 positivo Vegans best friend! Pros:Nutty taste, great qualityKeeps a very long time in the freezer!Very versatile, use in anything to make cheesyGood source of Vitamin B-12Cons:Packaging is different than pictured.I have to admit I normally have a pet peeve about not getting the packaging I'm shown on amazon! But I'm reviewing the product, not the seller, so keep that in mind when reading this (They just need to update their very outdated image of the packaging)
B00020HV1E1337990400 positivo OK flavor / Great Price I use Nutritional Yeast on my popcorn which gives it enough flavor that I don't have to add salt. I have used a more expensive brand which had a stronger yeast flavor but for the price, KAL brand is just fine.
B00020HV1E1335225600 positivo Excellent value! This is a fantastic price for a quality product. I have used other nutritional yeasts but like the texture, aroma, flavor, and color of this one. Shipping was prompt and arrived in perfect condition. I plan to sign up for ergular deliveries.
B00020HV1E1327276800 positivo Tastes great! Being a vegetarian, nutritional yeast is a great way to get nutrients. This product tastes great! I put it on pasta, potatoes, vegetables - it is a great seasoning and has a cheesy flavor. Highly recommended!
B00020HV1E1329436800 positivo Cheesy deliciousness for VEGANS!! I love KAL yeast flakes add this to your favorite vegetable dish, favorite snack like organic popcorn or whatever your cheesy heart desires. Yeast flakes is rich, nutritious and delicious. You must have this on you at all times it is great, you're a sprinkle away from deliciousness just click and add to your cart!! You can thank me later :)
B00020HV1E1327968000 positivo Delicious and Nutritious This is excellent nutritional yeast. I recommend this over Lewis Labs any day. Kal flakes taste great on pasta, in soups, etc.
B00020HV1E1319414400 positivo great value These yeast flakes are tasty and I find the large package a great value compared with the smaller sizes available in natural foods stores
B00020HV1E1317168000 positivo good stuff I like this stuff. Adds a nice flavor. Vegan. But I can pretend it's cheese-like! I sprinkle (liberally) on pasta (spaghetti) dishes often. I've made some "creamy" cheese-like substances with it, which taste good but only resemble cheese in yellow color and maybe a melted texture, not so much taste.It suggests mixing some with warm water for a snack. I tried this once, and there was no way it was for me, too strong by itself.Cheaper per ounce than my local health food store.
B00020HV1E1315353600 positivo Yummy and nutritious! Ladies if you are pregnant or trying to conceive, taking nutritional yeast is a wonderful food-based way to build up folic acid levels in early pregnancy. Also, it was effective in stopping morning sickness for me. Taking vitamin B-6 has been linked with reducing morning sickness, and nutritional yeast has it in abundance along with a wide range of other B-vitamins. If this is not enough, it's high in protein and tastes delish. I love it!
B00020HV1E1307491200 positivo Awesome for faux Mac & Cheese I hunted high and low for a GF/CF alternative for Mac & Cheese for my son. At last I found the answer and it is actually good tasting and good for health (unlike the real mac & cheese.) Life is good again!
B00020HV1E1299196800 positivo finally Super good on popcorn.....also, my sister likes it on open faced bagel and cream cheese with avocado and yeast.... its really good, trust me on that one..... also good on toast. But....Popcorn just seems bland without it now
B00020HV1E1298851200 positivo The best i've had thus far This nutritional yeast is great over popcorn with a little sprinkle of olive oil! It is packed full of b-vitamins and amino acids: A definite super-food! Great value compared to my local store, where I'd have to pay the same price for only half the size. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective health food supplement.
B00020HV1E1328486400 neutro Please sir, may I have some more? On second thought.... Yes, Kal yeast flakes are quite tasty like the other reviewers are saying. Before buying this brand, I had been buying Red Star Nutritional Yeast from my local store and dumping it on lots of things, on salads, in smoothies, on popcorn. I'm a borderline vegetarian and wasn't taking any B supplements so I figured that the yeast was a good idea. But as has been noted, it's pretty expensive. The Kal brand is a better deal and I just fill an old 5 oz Red Star container to make it easier to dispense. (I slightly prefer the Red Star product hence the 4 stars.) There is a point I must sadly bring up, though, and it's that if you use a heavy hand, you may see "results" where you don't want them. According to the label, 3 rounded tablespoons are 80 calories. By the time you've scarfed down the whole cannister of yeast flakes, you'll have consumed almost 2500 calories. So if you are wont to get a little crazy when you find a food you like, it might be worth remembering!
B00020HV1E1336089600 positivo Delicious Yeast Flakes, Brew Ha Ha ..folic acid? Nutritional yeast flakes have been part of my diet from a toddler, 62 years. Ma would make these wild milk shakes with soy protein, brewers yeast, blackstrap molasses, she called it "tigers milk" the yeast's nutty flavor with the sweet kiss of molasses...out of this world.Mix red pepper, garlic powder and brewers yeast, put that on your popcorn you'll forget all about butter, A table spoon in my coffee(8:00 arabica) endless possibilities, even the dogs benefit as yeast helps repel parasites, fleas, etc.I am also fighting chronic anemia so for me the folic acid isn't an issue but I certainly have paid attention to the issues in many of the comments. It is good to bring attention to the fact that everything in moderation is a reasonably good approach and doing homework on your own unique situation is the best approach of all.
B00020HV1E1290902400 positivo Pretty good I like this better than some I've had, but it does have a hint of bitterness compared to some (Bob's, mainly). This isn't really noticeable when used in recipes so it's only an issue when I'm sprinkling it straight onto foods. The flakes also seem smaller than many other brands I've used, making it dissolve a little quicker. I also think the flake size should be taken into account when measuring tried and true recipes, I think the actual weight would be a little heavier compared cup by cup for this.If rating for price for amount and quality only I would give this the full 5 stars-it's a great deal-but going on just the product itself, I give 4 stars because of the slight bitterness issue.
B00020HV1E1290124800 positivo Kal Nutritional Yeast Flakes I love this stuff! Nutritional yeast is a little expensive for the most part, especially in local stores. Buying in bulk is your best option, especially if you're like me and are addicted to the stuff. I'm glad I found this product (I purchased the 22 oz size, by the way). It's cheap and lasts quite a while. Nutritional yeast has a nutty, cheesy sort of flavor (try toasting it before using it in recipes), and can also impart a chicken-type flavor. I'm constantly making vegan "cheese" sauces and adding it to broths and gravies for a savory taste. It can be an acquired taste - some people love it right away; most have to grow into it. I didn't really like it at first, but now I'm obsessed with the stuff (similar to tofu).I recommend VegWeb.com for yummy recipes; the Tangy Cheeseless Cheese Sauce is my favorite! Try sprinkling it straight onto popcorn and pasta dishes. Bryanna Clark Grogan has a recipe for "Chicken-Style Broth Powder" using mainly nutritional yeast.BONUS: It's actually good for you! It's packed with amino acids, minerals, and B vitamins, including B12 (which all vegans should know is hard to get from a vegan diet). It's low in sodium and fat, and is suitable for most selective diets.
B00020HV1E1337990400 positivo Healthy for dieters If you've never tried nutritional yeast before, I would suggest trying it out! I have replaced cheeses with nutritional yeast for the added nutritional benefits and lower calorie content. The substitution has worked well in salads, scrabled eggs, soups, sandwiches. This might sound silly, but I've actually started prefering the nutritional yeast to shredded cheeses because I have come to love the taste so much! Make sure that whatever you add this to isn't too dry of an item, or the yeast's texture would be too dry.This brand through amazon has been a great choice for me because it is convenient and cheaper than in the specialty grocery stores. I highly recommend it!
B00020HV1E1334361600 positivo Absolutely love Kal Yeast Flakes I can't say enough about this product. I'm so happy that it is being sold on Amazon.com. And I'm happy to see such wonderful overall reviews. I've been taking Kal Yeast Flakes for years. There's nothing quite like it, in my book. It has amino acids, minerals and a powerhouse of B vitamins which I've always heard are great for the nervous system. I don't know what it is, but I always seem to feel a bit more clear-minded and levelheaded throughout the day after I've had my morning dose (a tablespoonful or two in apple or orange juice). Nice to have in the evening sometimes, too.This is a product that I've used and trusted for a long time. Wouldn't want to be without it.
B00020HV1E1297987200 positivo Popcorn, Spaghetti -- More, Please. I bought this for the first time on a whim about three months ago. Love it, love it, love it. Love it on popcorn, crave it on my spaghetti (with a touch of parmesian cheese added to it). I eat spaghetti for lunch maybe four to five times a week now (no sauce). Don't know if that's good or bad, but I heap the nutritional yeast on it and love it. I'm definitely not a vegan (not that there's anything wrong with that, I just love me meats), but I feel good that this product is so full of nutrients. I don't know how it compares to other brands. I bought this brand first and it tastes great to me, plus the price is cheaper than some others out there, so I figure, why buy anything else?
B00020HV1E1278028800 positivo Great yeast flakes I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about this product. Tastes great and is inexpensive compared to other nutritional yeast offerings. Comes in a nice resealable cardboard (oatmeal style) tube - and 22 oz of yeast flakes is a LOT! My kids love it on pasta & bagels - basically anywhere you would use sprinkle cheese. In fact, my kids now usually ask for 'yellow cheese' on stuff. Great product and great price.
B00020HV1E1337299200 positivo Great product for humans and cats We have been using this product for years. Our vets tell us our cats have the best-looking coats of any of their patients, and our cats DEMAND it on their food. Also seems to cut down on kitty tooth tartar. It is a great source of B vitamins. A staple in our household for the humans as well.
B00020HV1E1336089600 positivo Best Nooch EVER This is, hands down, the best nutritional yeast on the market. I use it in tofu scramble, on popcorn, on roasted vegetables, in soup. I even like to put a little bit in my hair when I've had a rough week. What do you think holds it up, slick?All joking aside - this product is phenomenal. I will only be buying KAL Nutritional Yeast Flakes from here on out!!
B00020HV1E1335830400 positivo YUMMY CHEESY FLAVORED GOODNESS! I didn't buy it off amazon, but I recently purchased a can at my local health food store and it does have a cheesy flavor. It reminds me of the flavoring on snack foods like Doritos. The smell isn't as appetizing, but it doesn't bother me. I love sprinkling it on my pasta dishes, it has such a delicious nutty flavor. I also notice a huge surge in my energy levels after eating it too.
B00020HV1E1332201600 neutro 1000's of Uses Makes a lot of things delicious (who would imagine that something with a name like "yeast flakes" could taste good?) Use instead of salt, sugar, many other empty or harmful ingredients. Get B-complex and other nutrients in a natural, tasty form. Spoon it into your milk, yoghurt, cocoa, hot or cold cereal, soups, veggies, sauces, salad dressing, popcorn, ice cream, your mouth, whatever. I even load my morning coffee with it; it adds a smooth and pleasantly "malty" flavor. Keeps forever at room temp.This review is mostly for newbies who could use a nudge of encouragement to try something that sounds strange; remember, life is full of pleasures that seemed strange the first time!
B0009RM2WS1208908800 positivo Be brave and just try it ! Put it in Yogurt or Applesauce My secret weapon to perform hard work with a great attitude. Guanine (a caffeine analog) gives a long lasting stimulant boost while theobromine provides the attitude adujstment of chocolate. A wonderful delight that got me to quit coffee which is jittery, short-acting and just pale in comparison.Guanine is oil-based so it's hard to dissolve in water but that allows for slow-release in your body. Be brave, depending on your body size use a teaspoon to a tablespoon. If you can consume a tablespoon of coffee you can certainly consume a tbsp of this.Instead of trying to dissolve into liquid put it in Yogurt or Apple Sauce. Makes a great low calorie breakfast that stays with you and reduces hunger.Truly an amazing product that leaves a six-hour silly grin on my face with motivation to clean the garage !
B0009RM2WS1189209600 positivo The real deal !!!! Better than coffee or ANY energy drink !!! This is the authentic, natural item. Stay away from any other product besides Guarana and Yerbe Mate'- read up on it !! good luck !!
B0009RM2WS1226361600 positivo get up & GO !!! This stuff is fantastic. I agree with the other complimentry reviews. might i suggest mixing a small amount of this powder with a shot of olive oil?! I actually think it may lengthen the effect even mnore by doing this and it is a fat soluble so it's a lot easier to get down. Because of the chemistry of this molecule, it is bitter and never tastes good. If it really bothers you, it's possible to order some gelatin capsules and make your own guarana capsules! That way you can swallow them and will not have to deal with the taste:)
B0009RM2WS1276992000 positivo Great! A little hard to swallow but well worth it. I used to drink two coffees a day, now I've quit coffee because of this product. Doing the math, it's actually saved me quite a bit of money. It works well as an appetite suppressant as well, I haven't been nearly as hungry.
B0009RM2WS1204848000 positivo Seems to work well... It is definitely authentic guarana powder. Seems to give u a good caffeine amount. Only problem is it never seems to incorporate into your drink. I've tried using a blender, a spoon and even soaking it overnight in water but you always have to shake it before you drink it cuz it doesn't disolve. Tastes not bad with just water though.
B000PGJ00U1218067200 positivo Tastes Great - Lower in calories and fat We buy these all the time. Has a great flavor, lower in calories and fat than regular cheese puffs and is higher in fiber. Keep in mind these won't taste as cheesy as "regular" cheese puffs (Cheetos, Jax, etc), but they still taste great. I get them because they're lower in calories, fat and healthier - and still taste great. Plus the price here is much better than in the supermarket.
B000CDI0YI1264896000 negativo A note to the coffee lovers I've had a few of WP's coffees before, which were fine. This medium light roast I purchased recently "Tuscan breakfast" was undrinkable. Yes, it smelled fresh and robust. Thats where the kind adjectives end. I brewed 2 pots of this acidic, bitter, and harsh beverage that I wouldnt wish on anyone first thing in the morning, before deciding to spare you all the same fate... A better name might have been "Industrial Byproduct". Of course, some people feel thats what makes a REAL coffee. But if this came to a my table at a restaurant, I would have been, to say the least, dissatisfied.A little side note for those purchasing this or one of the more acceptable blends... the bag is a nightmare to open. Save yourself the frustration and grab a scissors. Cut the whole top off which seems welded together down to the wire wrap.
B000B3ZFUQ1126915200 negativo Tooth Ache Hurt my tooth. And I was disappointed in the taste. Not enough sugar in it.
B000IG7NME1350345600 negativo Waste of money These looked wonderful and were a birthday present for a close friend. When they came the foil was all stuck to the candy. We tried to unwrap a couple and it made a bigger mess with the paper sticking terribly to the candy. In the end we were able to taste the tiniest piece which just made us more disappointed and angry since it was delicious. We would never order these again or do business with this company. And living in Florida was not the problem since we paid BIG prices for the candy and shipping, it was not hot and the package was literally put in our hands from the truck, so it didn't sit outside. Big Big disappointment.
B00070PA2G1356912000 neutro This product is very misleading. The only reason i bought this one over the others that i saw was cause of the picture. The picture shows that the candys come in small packets and not one big bag, but when i received the package it was one big bag nothing like what is shown in the picture.
B000PGJ01O1206403200 positivo SOOO yummie & good for you too! These are DELICIOUS!!! They are BAKED and MULTI GRAIN "cheeto-ish" crunchie snacks (I actually prefer them to the Cheetos Brand!)! I give them to my toddlers for a special snack and enjoy them myself! FINALLY a snack that's good for both KIDS and MOMS!! (P.S. - These are hard to find in the local grocery stores.)
B000HD5SFW1358467200 positivo delicious Great taste --- great snack.For the price I couldn't beat it. Onlyproblem, trying to eat in moderationwhen watching a movie!
B000HD5SFW1242518400 neutro Great if you have the munchies! Not gourmet, which it isn't meant to be. Doesn't have a rich toffee or buttery taste, but it's OK. I'd prefer a stronger flavor. Great for kids!
B000HD5SFW1220659200 positivo Good stuff! I've enjoyed Crunch n' Munch for years; and it's as good now as it ever was. I like it because it satisfies my craving for sweets without being too sweet; and compared to other sweet snacks, it is relatively healthy.
B000HD5SGG1279152000 negativo Disgusting Kettle corn should have a subtle sugar crunch. This did not. It tasted chemically bitter. I usually read labels, but did not think about it when buying this product. I would never have purchased anything with sucralose. I threw it out.
B000HD5SGG1191196800 positivo DELICIOUS!!!!! This stuff is great!!! Absolutely love it!!! It is not too salty and not greasy at all, especially compared to the "regular" kettle corn. Perfect snack for kids too!!!! Please keep stocking it as it is sometimes difficult to find at my local stores!
B000HD5SGG1187222400 positivo Fine taste and good for diets The popcorn tastes very good. It is 94% fat free, so it is a snack that will fill you up and not be unhealthy. It is a core food on the weightwatcher's plan.
B000HD5SGG1185840000 positivo Bring it Back!! This is the best popcorn ever--and it's healthy. Why did you take it off your list?
B000HD5SGG1278979200 negativo Sucralose! This popcorn is sweetened with sucralose. Do a search to read about sucralose. I'm not eating this or feeding it to my family.
B000HD5SGG1187740800 neutro Very Little Flavor I know this popcorn is healthy and all but it has very little flavor. I have had much better kettle korn, maybe kettle korn that is not as healthy, but at least I can taste it.

B00015BQB61273104000 neutro Adzuki beans Adzuki ( or Azuki) beans are ment to be used in asian sweets. You can make sweet bean paste by boiling the beans for 30-40 min, (changing the water out at least twice) draining and mashing the beans with sugar.(strain the paste if you do not like the bean skins) What you get is a paste that can be put on ice cream, fill pasteries or stuff into Mochi Cakes.

B000FBKGAS1293840000 positivo "Good Stuff" I first obtained this product in a gourmet chocolate shop in Punta Gorda, Florida. I enjoyed it very much, but after returning home to Maryland I had no idea where I could purchase more. I went to Amazon and there it was. Thank you, Amazon.
B000FBKGAS1287187200 positivo Great Museli. One of my local grocery stores carries some Familia products. Their Muselis are very good in general, but this Swiss Crunch with seeds is one of my favorites. It is very satisfying (I eat it cold with some Silk Light Vanilla soy milk) and the seeds add an interesting variation to the fruit bits in most of the Muselis I've tried. Amazon's price is great too.
B000FBKGAS1285545600 positivo Tasty morning crunch. I am partial to the Familia Swiss brand for my museli, but this is my favorite crunchy style. I prefer to have the nuts in the mix and add my own fruit as seasonally available. Freeze dried fruit is just never as good.
B000FBKGAS1229040000 positivo Great Product I tried the rest of Familia Muesli Products but this one I liked the most. Amazingly tasty and very crunchy.
B000FBKGAS1228953600 positivo Great! I like em a lot, wife thinks they're the best cereal she's ever had, teen daughter thinks they taste just a bit better than hamster food, the others here like them enough. Bags are pretty small but still a good enough deal that I'll buy again, just too good (and a unique flavor...really like the pumpkin seeds in them) not to.
B000FBKGAS1309392000 neutro I began buying this product in Dubai. For several years, I religiously carted bags home in my suitcase purchased at the French grocery store Carrefour in Dubai. Then this particular mix disappeared from the shelves.AT first I thought I had introduced too many colleagues to the "Best Cereal Ever". I only eat this particular cereal and mix it with organic yogurt and fresh fruit. Especially tasty with fresh peaches.After emailing Familia to inquire about the problem, I was pleasantly surprised to receive notification that they had a vendor in the US and I turned to Amazon.I am much happier now that Amazon delivers my cereal to my back door... just in case I am in Dubai when it arrives. Ahhh, the life of an International Flight Attendant!
B000FBKGAS1157155200 neutro An Excellent and Healthy Choice for Anyone's Diet A quality product from Bio-familia, a Swedish company that developed "Bircherm&uuml;esli" a product so popular and successful that made the name Muesli famous all over the world.If you need a high fiber and protein snack option for your diet, this is absolutely a very good product. You can't go wrong and the best of all: excellent taste and quality, and for a pack of five this comes at a good value.Sometimes your diet will require you eat frequently and consciously, and in those cases you need to have a snack at hand when you get hungry, in order to keep your metabolism high all day long. In such cases finding a good and balance option could be hard. I love this 5-pack and I always have one at home an another pack at the office. I try to eat five or more times a day, so in my case having a healthy snack at hand wherever I am when I get hungry is a priority.Since you are checking this product I have to guess that you are probably a person that cares about what you eat, either because you are interested in losing weight, getting in better shape or just be healthier and keep in good shape, so I will share my own experience in the weight loss game and staying in shape gameMy own successful personal experience in weight loss is based on strategies to boost metabolism. Don't stress yourself, eat frequently, eat just what you need each time, and choose wisely what you are going to eat, supplement your diet. Yet simple and it works. I loss more than 200 lbs and shrink my waist (from 44 to 32), and I have been able to keep in good shape since then. Every single aspect of my life has improved since then.Keep in mind that a good diet is just part of the equation, you also need a plan that helps you keep on track and monitor your condition. Based on my own personal experience I can recommend some tools that you may want to consider, to establish your own strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off. They are:- "Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss" by Mark Hyman. A practical an realistic plan for weigh loss.- "The ABS Diet", which is another very practical, readable, insightful, and inspirational book, that also includes an exercise plan.- A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism).- A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism).- "Heart Monitor Training for the Complete Idiot", a primer on the use of Heart Rate Monitors for health improvement or weight control.If you want to star focusing only on your diet, the first two may be worth considering. If you exercise, or want to start doing it right, the last threee are for you. If you do both, all the recommended options can improve your results.I am 39 years old, With the help of the tools I just mentioned not only I went fro size 44 to size 32 pants, but also obtained substantial benefits that included weight control, cardiovascular improvements, lowered blood pressure, and improved muscular-skeletal strength and flexibility, but also the myriad of mental and psychological benefits derived from being in the best shape of my life.
B000MNRF8U1212883200 positivo Malty Breakfast. Given that it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name "breakfast tea" (and given that Drysdale's creation would soon come to be (mis)appropriated by tea houses south of the border, who proceeded to add the word "English" to its name), it seems only fitting that the Scots should have their own version of breakfast tea, too, after all. Even stronger than the already potent English Breakfast blend, this particular one is made to match not only the traditionally heavy English but even the Scottish breakfast, which like the English variety includes pork, sausages and eggs, but is amplified by that so distinctly Caledonian culinary creation: haggis (to most of the rest of the world, a classic case of "acquired taste" at best). A blend of primarily Indian teas, Scottish Breakfast contains a particularly high percentage of Assam, which with its malty flavor ideally complements the soft Scottish mountain waters ... as well as Scotland's famous single malt whiskies, the "water of life" ("uisgue beatha") likewise coming from the areas where those same mountain waters are flowing.Due to its strength, Scottish Breakfast tea maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. As an everyday "work horse" and early morning pick-me-up it is easily as good as (if not better than) its more famous sibling from south of the border, or any kind of coffee. Enjoy!
B000MNRF8U1311984000 positivo Taylors' Scottish Breakfast Tea I really love this tea, and I cannot start the day without it. It has a full bodied and malty flavor. I like it with a little milk, but it's also great on its own. I wish the leaves were whole, as is the Taylors' Assam, Doomur Dulling, but that is my only nick against it. I've tried both, and I still prefer the taste and fully body of the Scottish Breakfast Tea.
B000MNRF8U1354579200 positivo Great tea I am a big fan of breakfast teas and this is one of my favorites. It has a little more body than most English Breakfast teas and goes well with most brunch food. I take it with a bit of milk, but it is good without, as well.
B000B5QGTI1149120000 positivo The Definition of Gourmet! If you have never had pumpkin seed oil then you are missing out on one of the great flavors of the world! A tiny touch of this soft, fragrant oil added to a spring or summer pasta dish creates a heavenly delight.Try a small splash bit over mushroom ravioli in a light gorgonzola cream sauce and toasted pine nuts. A mouth orgy!Use a small amount in a home made viniagrette salad dressing with a few threads of saffron and pour over crisp butter lettuce with red pear slices and tiny clumps of Humboldt Fog Blue cheese.Take a slice of fresh Italian Calabrese or French peasant bread and dip it in the oil and let your toungue dance with pleasure.You'll wonder where this oil has been hiding all these years.
B00015BQBQ1229817600 positivo Can't Go Wrong. You really can't go wrong with blackeye peas. They cook up nice and tender but not mooshy, and tasted of real blackeye peas not like the commercial brands that have sugar and other flavors added in....pure natural beans. Excellent.

B000HD5SG61336262400 neutro Terrible shipping This product arrived with the box broken open which had been put back together with packing tape. The perforated display box was punched open and I received only 11 of the 12 packages that where originally in the box. The shipper should have put the display box inside a regular brown shipping box in order to avoid this problem. I'm giving 3 stars because the sunflower kennels were fresh and very good, however, because of this problem I am reluctant to order this product again fearing that I might receive fewer than 11 packages next time. I've decided to place my next order with another company through Amazon.
B000HD5SG61332201600 positivo Good product; pricey online The product is not easy to find in stores around rural Mississippi. The kernels allow me, a person with nut allergies, to enjoy a nut-like texture without the allergens. However, it is a little expensive to purchase online.
B000HD5SG61308787200 neutro Contains Transfats The nutritional information on the packages I got do not match what is on the website here. Each bag has 4g of trans fats. Why the discrepancy? Why do they need to add that to sunflower kernels?
B000HD5SG61206230400 neutro 0.5 g of Trans Fat per serving I bought some because it was advertised as "A healthy snack choice..." only to find out when it arrived that it has half a gram of trans fat per serving due to its use of a partially hydrogenated oil.
B000HD5SG61198800000 positivo Simply the best! As a kid, everyone loved to eat sunflower seeds and spit out the shells, but as we get older, we no longer need the sore tongue from the salt when we can enjoy what is inside them in the first place! This is my favorite snack!! They are no longer available in the stores in my town so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon. I was concerned they might be out of date freshness-wise, but was delighted to find they were not and I am ordering another box today!
B000HD5SG61216598400 positivo Very good. These sunflower seeds are very crunchy and have just the right amount of salt. I love to sprinkle them on salads. Mmmmm yummy. My order arrived with six months to go before the expiration date and I found that even after they had "expired" by about a month or two they were still very good. I like buying the seeds in the 8.5 ounce packages because they stay fresh longer than when I open one large bag.Update 7/11Nutritional Facts from actual package (Amazon's facts are all wrong according to the manufacturer's label):Serving Size 1/4 cup (30g)Calories per serving 190Calories from fat 140Total fat 15gSaturated fat 2gTrans Fat 0.5gPolyunsaturated fat 8gMonounsaturated fat 4.5gCholesterol 0mgSodium 220mgTotal Carbs 4gDietary fiber 3gSugars less than 1gProtein 9gCalcium 2%Iron 8%Vitamin E 40%Niacin 10%Folic Acid 20%Phosphorous 25%Magnesium 25%Zinc 10%ingredients:Sunflower kernels, Partially hydrogenated soybean oil, Salt.

Haven't found any bad ones at all. Each bag is resealable, so that helps keep in the freshness, too. Great price, great deal from Amazon. Will order again. Highly recommended.
B000HD5SG61318636800 positivo HEB HEB is a Texas icon grocery store. They chose to not stock David Sunflower Kernels. The store brand they chose to substitute for David is so bad we had to throw it away uneaten. Thanks for selling the David brand.
B000HD5SG61255737600 positivo Love sunflower seed ? Get this ! Good price for these. Very fresh for the 2 sets I've purchased so far. Now I am "auto-subscribed" to getting theses every few months.
B000HD5SG61243296000 positivo Sunflower kernels Very satisfied with product. Great quality, entire family enjoys them and best price anywhere.
B000HD5SG61216857600 positivo Great Snack! They are a very good value. Package size is just right. Great on salads, but we like them best to snack on.
B000HD5SG61264291200 negativo lousy the product purchased was david sunflower kernels. although the product date was not expired it tasted very stale, rancid. it is my guess this product was subjected to extreme heat or some type of poor storage. i ordered two cases, twenty large bags. we are "slogging" our way through it even though it doesn't taste fresh. it even smells stale. i doubt i order from you again as a result of this experience. my last order was fine. what happened here? new supplier? it is not acceptable product. i don't understand the difference in quality between these two orders. you won't have repeat business if you ship this kind of stale product. i have told friends of my experience. don't you realize you not only lose my business but the fact that i share my experience with friends and family means they too will not order product that is shipped in this unacceptable condition. it is a hassle to return items. i was willing to make purchases when there were no problems but once this happens I no longer am willing to go through the hassle. It costs money to ship returns. Shame on you.esther jones
B000HD5SG61360540800 positivo David Seeds Sunflower Kernels, 8.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12) This is great, my husband really likes this brand and our local grocery stores had stoppedselling them. He uses them on cereal.
B000HD5SG61349049600 neutro Sunflower Seed Particulates I have a case of 8.5 ounce packages sent to me every-other month.Normally, I am quite satisfied with what I receive.So far every package in this last order - I just opened package #7 out of 12- is consistantly sunflower seeed dust. I must have received the packages that were filled with the last of the stuff in the bottom of the bin at the factory.The problem is that because I received one case from one specific packaging period at the factory - they are ALL like that. If I had bought them at a retail store one or two at a time, I probably would have only gotten one or two out of 12 bags of this quality.YUK!

B00015BQCA1203465600 neutro Where were these grown? They won't tell you. I buy organic cranberry beans in 25-50 lb lots. They are a staple in our household. I had hoped to buy some from Barry Farm, and assumed - from their name - that they grew them. After all, they are a "farm," right? Understanding that some "organic" beans come from China, I thought I would call Barry Farms to confirm the country of origin for their beans. The female who took my call told me that they don't know where these beans come from since they get them from a distributor (so much for the "farm" in "Barry Farms"). I asked if she could give me the contact information for the distributor so that I could ask them directly. Her answer: "no". I asked if THEY could find out from the distributor where these beans come from. Her answer: "no". Thanks, but I'll do my business elsewhere.UPDATE: I ended up buying from Italian Harvest - a dot com.SECOND UPDATE: Italian Harvest no longer has an organic Borlotti/Cranberry bean, so this year I purchased from Purcell Mountain Farms, and am very pleased with their product.

B000C024341361491200 positivo Great Gift for Butter Lover This was a gift for my father-in-law who loves to enjoy butter with bread or crackers. It was somewhat of a joke gift, but he loved it. I am told that he guarded his &#34;fancy&#34; butter from regular use and insisted it was only for special enjoyment.
B000EZG1UO1170028800 positivo Afternoon Darjeeling Tea-Fits Me to a Tea! I will definitely buy more. I brew all Darjeeling teas strong with distilled water and sweeten with sugar. I like the temperature to be between warm and hot which brings out the flavor. The beautiful clear amber-rose color makes me eager to drink my first glass of the day. This is what gets me out of bed in the morning! Anticipation! The delivery was tops. I love the reasonable price for this premium tea. The packaging is excellent as I always move my teas to a metal container as some teas do not come in a tin. I am very satisfied and pleased with this one.

B00015BQCK1227139200 neutro Odd I called Barry Farm and spoke with two women to find out if there is any possible gluten contamination with the beans. Neither knew if the beans could have gluten on them because they are from a supplier and don't actually grow them. When I asked who the supplier was she rather curtly said, "I will not give out the names of my suppliers". I found that odd, on so many levels, and wondered if her suppliers are in China. A company has never refused to give me their supplier before. The best part was telling me I could wash the gluten off when I rinsed the beans. Due to all the recall mania, I am not willing to gamble my family's health. Anyone else wondering what they do grow at Barry Farm? The whole thing left me with the heebie-jeebies.
B000E60V361240876800 positivo om nom nom Bragg products are kind of strange. Without exception, every one I have ever had is a high-quality handcrafted old fashioned artisan condiment. They are sensitive to people with allergies, and have detailed labels that help show exactly what is in everything they make. Bragg products are also made by actual, bona fide crazy people. They're some kind of hilarious vinegar-cult, with bible quotes all over their bottles and website, and links to articles about how fluoride is deadly poison, and drinking glasses of vinegar will make you live forever, and the world seed cartels are trying to murder apple trees, and gulf war syndrome was caused by the deadly neurotoxin Nutra-Sweet. I mean, seriously. These people are ACTUALLY crazy. But they make delicious products. This one is no exception.It's a surprisingly hearty asian-style dressing that goes well on absolutely any kind of veggies, or as a meat marinade. It's delicate while still being robust, mostly due to the use of the Bragg Aminos. They're a soy-sauce substitute that is less salty and more savory, with big round mouth-feel. In this application it works very well. The ginger and sesame flavors are pronounced without being overwhelming, and the honey and garlic still have enough room to come thorough. This dressing would be a good choice even if it wasn't super healthy, but the health benefits just make it a slam dunk. Awesome stuff. You don't have to be a deranged conspiracy wing-nut to enjoy good salads.
B000E60V361206403200 positivo Vegielicious Bragg does it again with this All Natural Ginger & Sesame Salad dressing which begs you to find vegetables to eat. This dressing makes your vegies so delicious that you almost want to just keep eating vegetables. What is even most pleasuable is to know that you enjoyed a healthy dressing with no regrets. An added benefit is the reasonable price.
B000E60V361278633600 neutro DELICIOUS Overall the flavor is that of apple cider vinegar rather than the ginger or sesame, but I know people who are not vinegar people and still love this dressing. It is very refreshing on salads and you just seem to feel better after eating it! I often put it on just tomatoes or just cucumbers and let it marinate for a while before eating. My only complaint is that the bottle can be a little leaky at first if you don't remove the sealing disk, and you really need to shake it up well when you first open it to prevent the first few servings from being too oily.
B000E60V361308873600 neutro Yummy, but little or no sesame or ginger flavor I'm a great fan of Bragg's aminos, and so was delighted when I saw the Ginger & Sesame salad dressing for sale, and bought a bottle.It is very tasty mild salad dressing, and I can see sesame seeds floating around, and something shredded which is presumably ginger. The dressing is a yummy sweat-sour--which I presume from Bragg's Apple Vinegar and honey, but I can detect no sesame nor ginger flavor. Unlike other reviewers, I do not taste any hint of Bragg's Aminos in "Ginger & Sesame Salad Dressing" (even though it is listed among the ingredients), in anycase, it could use alot more.The biggest problem I have with premixed "oil and vinegar" dressings is that if you put them in the frig, the oil solidifies---meaning you have to wait a half-an-hour everytime you want to use the oil. Leaving the dressing "out", here in the tropics, is inadvisable. In addition, I find salad dressings from which the components settle out in a few seconds to be annoying, forcing me to shake-and-pour, shake-and-pour, shake-and-pour. However, oil and vinegar, separately, do NOT have to be refrigerated, and do not have to be shaken. If you want an oil-and-vinegar dressing, it is better to simply use oil, vinegar (or lemon juice) and spices separately:For a moderately premium olive oil, I recommend ColavitaColavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 34-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)For vinegar, you can use Bragg's Apple Vinegar.Bragg - Apple Cider Vinegar, 32 oz liquidor a nice balsalmic vinegar. However fresh lemon juice (and a little lemon zest) is much better.Microplane 40020 Classic Zester/GraterIf you want sesame flavor, mix a little sesame oil with your oil, or drizzle it on separately. For example:Kadoya - Pure Sesame Oil 5.5 Oz.Dry sesame seeds are also available in the spice section of most grocery stores, which you can sprinkle on salads. For example:Bob's Red Mill White Sesame Seeds, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)If you want ginger flavor, grate a little fresh ginger over your salad using the microplane zester. My grocery sells tubes of minced ginger in the cool-foods section---the tubes are almost as good as fresh ginger. Dried ginger is available in the spice section of your grocery. For example:GINGER GROUND FRESHLY PACKED IN LARGE JARS, spices, herbs, seasoningsFor example:S&B; - Oroshi (Shoga ginger paste) in tube 1.41 Oz.Instead of salt, spinkle a little Braggs Aminos on your salad.Otherwise, I prefer stiff mayonaise-based dressings. They can be refrigerated without solidifying, and "stick" to the vegies better. I usually add flavors and spices (fresh ginger, cilantro, garlic, lemon zest, minced olives, minced dill pickle, mustard seeds, etc.) to mayonaise, as needed for the particular salad or vegetable dish I plan to serve. Similar homemade mayo-based condiment makes a super sandwich spread, a "sauce" for vegetables side-dishes, or a dip for battered fish, "french" fries, tempura, etc. For non-leafy salads and for vegetables, I often serve the dressing "on the side" and use it more as a dip.Conclusion: Braggs Ginger & Sesame salad dressing is a good salad dressing, but I like something a little more convenient and flavorful.General RecommendationAfter major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it. If you watch, you'll be surprised by how radically and quickly the prices on Amazon can change. I've seen many examples of prices doubling (or dropping in half) over an hour's time. $5.49 (the price at the time of this writting is a good price---I just paid $7.15 at a local grocery).
B000E60V361287964800 positivo Love it! Fantastic flavor given a depth by the Bragg's amino acids (I'm guessing). The ginger and sesame is not overpowering but well-received by our house.

B00014H7101338508800 negativo Did Nothing I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.

As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.
B00014H7101253232000 negativo Have never recieved, and for some reason I can't track. I ordered this product a week ago and I have not recieved it yet. I don't know where it is. My credit card has been charged and their has been no tea as of yet on my doorstep. I am not happy. I go to the tracking site and it can't even tell me where it is. I don't see a number anywhere to call. I fear I've been duped.
B00014H7101238630400 positivo On time and as described!! I was very happy with my order. It arrived on time and as described. Thank you!!
B00014H7101294099200 positivo I love this tea! First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!
B00014H7101336003200 positivo Cinnamon Spice I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.
B00014H7101239408000 positivo This product is Great This product is great it really works. I have lost a total of 15 pounds in two months wihout exercising. I reconmend this product to everyone.
B00014H7101299801600 positivo Got Me Running This tea product got me running alright, to the crapper. But it did help loose about 10 lbs, mostly compacted fecal matter. I also feel more energized and feeling alot better. Before taking this product my best friend was a couple of cups of black coffee but since taking this for the last month my craving for coffee and sweets has subsided, however i now have to bulk up on toilet paper. Great product great buy!
B00014H7101235692800 positivo Keeps me on track I love this product, it helps keep things moving! I use it twice a day afternoon and evening while dieting. A great product for helping maintain your weight.
B00014H7101215993600 positivo Good Product I have used this product in the past and was highly satisfied. It works very well. I would just caution first time users not to make the tea too strong or your results may be "too good".
B00014H7101319673600 positivo good stuff! This product works very well. It taste great. Its a nice touch to the end of a day. PLEASE USE AS DIRECTED! PLEASE!!!!!
B00014H7101297209600 positivo Works for me ! ! ! I have been using this tea for a few years now, and I drink the full 2 cups every night before I go to bed. It begins to take effect the next morning. I gave a bag to a friend to try & she loved it as well, she now orders it online.
B00014H7101244678400 positivo You really go when taken as directed. Works great for me and also help me with my weight. I don't like the drink as much but I drink it as needed.
B00014H7101354147200 positivo Lightly Cinnamon, Decent Tea, Medicinally Works When doing a low-carb diet, constipation can often be a problem, especially in the beginning stages when the carbs are the most restrictive. It's a complaint many people have about low-carbing. Now, if you're doing it right, it shouldn't be that way, but sometimes it just happens. Also, someone with chronic illnesses and also those who take pain medication regularly might find themselves with a bout of constipation too. So while I know this is called a 'dieter's tea' and I know that some people use it for cleansing and even for dangerous weight loss by drinking too much of it to 'flush out' the foods they eat, this tea can actually be used safely and for good purposes when used properly for constipation relief.It takes a little bit to find the right level of brewing to make this work for you. Too little, and it doesn't do much, too much and you'll explode and run to the bathroom almost right after drinking it. Find the right balance, the right steeping level vs. water for you, and you'll simply have a normal, easy relief the next morning. Once or twice per week, after a meal, works great for most folks I've talked to. Works wonderful for me when needed.The flavor is great too. I've tried the other flavors of this brand, and I don't like them. My best friend likes the lemon though, so to each their own, but for me, the cinnamon is the best. It's lightly sweet on its own, but sometimes I'll still add a little honey.Good stuff, and if properly steeped, it doesn't cause cramping or pain or unflattering gas, with a decent taste. Definitely recommend if it's something you need.
B00014H7101354752000 neutro Wasted a lot of good tea. I love the tea and have bought it before but this new packaging has teabags so thin that they explode. I am very disappointed.
B00014H7101354665600 neutro What I was looking fore but better value can be found While this is a product that I purchase regularly (no pun intended), there is a better value on Amazon that is double the number for about the same price. Unfortunately, I picked the wrong one.
B00014H7101341964800 positivo very good taste A lot of tea for the price... ...no sweetener needed... The product works better than I expected it to. I also didn't realize how much I was ordering. I am enjoying this product. Has very good taste.
B00014H7101340582400 positivo Cinnamon Sensation This tea has a superb taste. I actually look forward to drinking this tea with my dinner. Now that it is summer I drink is as an iced tea, but this is also a very delicious hot drink too! I use splenda and fresh mint when I brew it. Fabulous!
B00014H7101333929600 positivo Stay regular!!! Reality strikes. I have been drinking this tea every night for 10 years ! It is the best thing to keep me on the straight n narrow!
B00014H7101333584000 neutro really disappointed though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed. i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results. the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes. still nothing.i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck. i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did
B00014H7101330732800 neutro Really works! Ok, so the "Dieter's" part is just a gimmick. But this tea really does a great job of keeping things moving, if you catch my drift. Follow the directions carefully! Steep it too long and you will spend a lot of time in the bathroom. This is my favorite flavor.
B00014H7101329696000 neutro its ok i got this tea hoping it would be better than my dieters delight china slim tea but it isnt. it does make you use the bathroom but not enough for you to feel cleansed for that particular day...i have no choice but to finish thus package but i will be going back to my regular tea afterwards
B00014H7101329177600 positivo Not the original This tea is ok but it's not nearly as potent as the original product that was available 5-10? Years ago.
B00014H7101357689600 positivo It &#34;worked&#34; as I expected. I recieved the product in a nice time frame and it lived up to my expectations. I would recommend it.
B00014H7101189382400 positivo pretty good I like this product, but I wouldn't use it daily. I learned this the hard way. It is stronger then you think!!!!!
B00014H7101353456000 neutro It's changed a bit, but still does the job... I've used this product for the last 15 or so years and it is good for one primary thing: To get you going. I don't really know why they call it a &#34;diet&#34; tea, since it doesn't help you burn fat, give you energy, curb your appetite, boost your metabolism etc.That said, this is my #1 go-to item for constipation. My grandmother is 92, and when she came to live with me, she had been nervous about the move etc. Long story short, she was &#34;plugged up&#34; and hadn't gone in nearly two weeks. She has had a kidney removed, so the Dr. said to steer clear of any magnesium based products. So knowing that, I tried a more natural approach.I tried the orange fiber powder, green tea with honey, prune juice, apple juice, and after nothing had worked, laxatives for three straight days.... And still nothing!So this had been sitting in my cupboard for ages, and I remembered that when I had used this, it sent me to the bathroom.I gave her a large cup of this and by the next afternoon...well, let's just say &#34;Laci Le Beau helped her go, go go.&#34;She still has problems with regularity, so every 4 days, I give her a cup of this to keep everything in order.I'd give this five stars, but the new bags are VERY flimsy. With the old bags, I would let them steep for 15 minutes, squeeze the bag to get the strong oils out, and steep again for another 15 or so...The other day I was using the new 2012 bags and was using a hot/cold office (5 gallon bottles) dispenser. I put the teabag in the cup and the force of the water actually burst the bag open as I was filling the cup. I had tea leaf bits floating in my cup. Whatever material they are using now is so weak, I'll have to add the teabag to the water after the cup is full. I certainly won't be able to squeeze the last bits of oils out of the leaves now...Still worth 4 stars though. Oh and one more thing... I add some lemon juice and honey to this. It tastes really good that way.
B00014H7101346803200 positivo Tea that works to clear all digestive stoppage. This tea works on my fiance's digestive track as she has an issue with colitis and this product along with essential enzymes helps her to absorb and digest foods that otherwise would give her pains while in her digestive track, Thank you for making this product we plan to continue using it as long as we can.
B00014H7101342310400 neutro tastes good, works great One must know that this dieter's tea helps mostly by moving your bowels along. Be careful at first, or it will be unpleasant!
B00014H7101314230400 positivo This was great!! I love this tea the taste is really good and it smells good as well my husband and I are year around tea drinkers and also we dont even have to add any sugar ( well I use honey on some teas) but this one you don't need anything extra and I will say it really does work drink plenty of water threw out the day .... And usually in the am you will be cleaning it out lol ... I didn't have any stomach pains or anything but I eat well also!! I recommend this to any and everyone!!
B00014H7101300060800 neutro Basically a laxative... I never drink this tea alone. I always steep it with another tea, such as Oolong or Jasmine because the taste isn't the best. I use honey and sugar to sweeten and down the hatch it goes! Expect some, um, gastrointestinal responses the next day. Sometimes I feel a bit of cramping and sometimes I don't. Sometimes it will take most of the next day for it to 'work'...and sometimes it won't!!
B00014H7101357776000 neutro They make you poop I'm going to talk about poop in my review, so if that offends you, please skip reading this! I've tried the "original" flavor (which is... herb-y and kind of gross), but this is a review for the cinnamon spice (which is still slightly herb-y, but tastes pretty decent.)I never understand why these teas are marketed as "dieter's tea". Don't use this to lose weight. The only weight you'll lose is from all that crap and water you're expelling from your bowels (literally crap. I made a poop joke. Hehe. Okay, sorry. Back to my review.)If you want to lose weight, eat less "standard American diet" foods, eat more veggies, and move more. The end. Seriously, don't use this as your weight loss method. I've tried it, and it just gives you stomach cramps for a few weeks, and you'll lose more friends than pounds because basically you just have diarrhea all the time.The real purpose of the product? It's for pooping.This is a laxative tea for when you're constipated. If you've never had this before, here's what I discovered about a decade ago, when I was a teenager with body image issues and found my mom's "dieter's tea": brewed myself a huge cup (kept the teabag in), chugged it, spent the next night and day with wild stomach cramping and diarrhea. Lovely, am I right? To combat this, keep the brew times short, especially at first. You should feel... something... within 24 hours.Overusing laxatives will make you have even more bowel problems. It contains senna, which is a "natural" compound, but your body will start to get used to it, and you'll need more and more, every time, and suddenly your anus is either leaking or so clenched up that you can't poop without help. Apparently, you can use it safely up to 30 days, but I personally don't use it more than 2 days in a row, and I pretty much only use it if for whatever reason (stress, forgetting to eat any veggies/fruits, etc) I have been constipated for more than 2 days. I like it better than senna tablets, but it's hard to control how strong the tea will be.If you're chronically constipated, I would personally suggest using this a few days a week, and supplementing your diet with a fiber supplement likeVitafusion Fiber Gummies 220 Count Sugar Freeor by adding a bunch of fibrous plants/veggies and other natural sources of fiber into your diet.)If you're into "cleanses", holyyy mother, this will make you feel pretty empty inside, like an angsty teenager. Just take a few strong cups, brace yourself through the cramping, and prepare to feel nice and clean inside. Don't do this too often, though, and don't do this if you need to work the next day.The cinnamon spice flavor tastes pretty good, but not a super strong cinnamon taste, as I expected/hoped. The box I got came with 2 medium-sized plastic bags (sealed) of tea bags. The tea bags that I got are pretty well constructed. I put them in an airtight container for storage. If you don't have one, keep them in a ziplock. If you leave them exposed to air, the tea will taste stale after a few weeks.
B00014H7101355702400 neutro A good staple... Have used this product for many years - but only as a way to &#34;regulate&#34;.... My husband fights keeping his bowel movements regular daily - I just have a little cup of &#34;diet tea&#34; every evening - and &#34;wallah&#34;! no problems here... lol. I do not use it as a weight/diet program; but for this reason, it works for me....
B00014H7101342569600 positivo Can't live without it! I have been using Laci Le Beau Super Dieters Tea for years. There is no subsitute. Many women in my family use it as well. This keeps me moving better than anything else and I suffer from Chronic Constipation. I would recommend this to anyone who could use a gentle, natural laxitive. I've never felt like I've taking a harsh stimulant, it just makes you feel & go like normal :) I hate poop talk but this is worth sharing! LOL
B00014H7101240272000 positivo Good Product. Extremely effective! I don't use this tea for dieting but more so for a natural cleanse to keep the body free of harmful toxins. It is very effective have used it for years! First time users may experiece cramping but, after awhile they cease. Great Effective Product!
B00014H7101361750400 positivo Yes I use this tea regularly. It really does the job and keeps things working...if you know what I mean. I reuse the tea bags.
B00014H7101360886400 positivo It works LL is a great cleanser but be aware that when it goes to work you should be near a facility. I find it a bit harsh and prefer Mirolax which is tasteless and has a much milder effect...at least for me. However, the first time I used LL, I lost 5 pounds in 3 days. Everyone is different so don't take that as &#34;your&#34; baseline. Can't hurt to try. I usually mix it with a flavored tea (berry, peach, orange etc.) as the taste alone leaves a bit to be desired for my pallet.
B00014H7101360281600 positivo Shame On My Local Merchant I'm sooo happy I found this tea on Amazon.com. The price for 60 bags is unbelievable at best. I have always purchased this tea with 30 tea bags for 8.99 from a local merchant in my neighborhood. In an attempt save more of my hard earned money, I began checking prices of my favorite things elsewhere and low and behold I found my tea on Amazon.com. I now get 30 more bags (a total of 60) for about 3.00 more. I have a good mind to stand outside of his store and advise the patrons to check Amazon for any products he sells. I've already found several at much cheaper prices on Amazon. Hell, he probably orders from Amazon and re-sales the product. THANK YOU AMAZON!
B00014H7101360108800 positivo This tea is FANTASTIC! I love this tea. The taste is great and works well. I drink 2 cups a day and feel amazing. Will keep buying for sure.
B00014H7101357776000 positivo Great price, have purchased this for over 25 years! On days when ice and snow lasts for weeks, and when I know I need to have a boost with cleansing, and don't want to drive, free shipping and great pricing make this an easy choice for purchase on Amazon!
B00014H7101357516800 neutro made me sick I was so hoping to love this product after reading some of the good reviews, however, these made me so nauseous and sick. i don't think i can ever drink tea again because of how sick these made me feel. It might have just been a reaction to my system, and my system only....but i'm throwing my box away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :o(
B00014H7101357516800 positivo The BEST Cinnamon Tea This is far and away the best cinnamon tea I have ever found. It's quite difficult to find a cinnamon tea without added flavors like apple. This is just cinnamon tea, and it's aroma and taste is that of fresh cinnamon. Also I drink this after dinner to curb my carb cravings, and amazingly, it does the trick.
B00014H7101357084800 neutro did nothing I got the tea fast, and followed the instructions, only drinking 1/2 cup, which had no effect on my system, it taste pretty good though.
B00014H7101355961600 neutro Tasty The tea is delicious, but I haven't experience the &#34;runs&#34; as mentioned by other reviewers -- even when I let it steep for a long period. I have, over a period of a week, found myself to be more regular. Overall, I like the product and will continue to use it to promote regularity. Maybe being more regular will get that scale moving downward again. :)
B00014H7101355961600 neutro It works sometimes. Sometimes this tea works as I tended other times it doesn't. This may be because I have IBS, and the senna in tea sometimes upsets my stomach. You need to drink plenty of water though or it's less effective.
B000C0244I1171324800 neutro re-wrapped oozing cheese Lovely sentiment, not what was expected, though. Somehow thought the cheese would be in a gift box similar to the one shown, not just stuffed into dismal styrofoam. I'm not certain what to make of the leaking eplorateur that was rewrapped in some plastic wrap....hmmm..wonder if it was shipped out that way or someone had opened the container -it's below freezing here, so doubt it "thawed" en routewill probably go out for dinner or to the jeweler next year
B000C0244I1254614400 positivo The best cheeses ever. My sister and her husband are enjoying every mouthful of the wonderful cheeses. Do not let it go by without trying them.
B000C0244I1173484800 neutro Melted Cheese... but Customer Service was good I was disappointed to get the cheese melted in the box upon arrival - it made quite a mess. Informed Customer Service and they sent another cheese right away. Unfortunately, it was even more melted the second time. Igourmet did reimbuse for the one cheese variety that melted... I was still stuck cleaning up the mess of melted cheese on the other two warm varieties. Perhaps not a good idea for anyone in a hot climate... especially if your ordering for a special occasion.
B000EMK3VU1293667200 neutro Not discontinued! Despite the many comments online that Tuna Tetrazzini is gone the truth is it's not discontinued, it's simply harder to find. Go to your bigger chain grocers (my Ralph's always has it in stock and frequently has 10/$10 sales) or Super Wal-Mart. Basically any store that normally has a wide selection of Helper flavors. Your smaller grocery chains, Target, Walgreens, etc will not have it. They onlywant to carry the Creamy Pasta and Creamy Broccoli varieties for some reason. Why this is the case makes no sense. When I was growing up tetrazzini was the favorite flavor in our house and you could always find it at the store. Betty Crocker has been making some baffling changes to the Helper line like refusing to put microwave directions on the box (check online if you need them), making flavors harder to find, and reducing the amount of noodles in certain varieties. If you really can't find Tetrazzini, go with Tuna Melt, the other good TH flavor. The others are just not good.
B000EMK3VU1236643200 neutro Short Expiration Date I really like this Tuna Helper. What I did not like is that the case that I received had experation dates for March 2009! I ordered this shipment the end of December 2008. That's only 3 months! And I bought a case, so that was 6 boxes! I did not notice this until this month, so now I feel like I need to use them all up very soon! When you buy this product in a grocery store, you usually have at least an entire year before the "best if used by" date! I will not buy a case of anything through Amazon again, unless it is something I don't have to worry about the expiration date.
B000EMK3VU1225238400 positivo Tuna Tetrazzini This product, in my opinion, is the best of the Tuna Helper flavors. Its flavor is bright, not muddy or overly thick and the noodles hold their texture. I add a little parmesian cheese to it. Can't find it in any of the stores in Tucson, Arizona.
B000EMK3VU1170720000 positivo The Best of the Tuna Helpers All the Tuna Helpers are excellent, but the Tetrazzini is the best in my view. Oddly, the one package I used of my shipment from Amazon did not have the extraordinary flavor of the one I purchased in our local store. Since my original purchase, my local store does not carry the Tetrazzini Tuna Helper. I am willing to accept that the one package I purchased from Amazon was not a true sample of the excellent Tetrazzini put out under the Tuna Helper label. Since the product is, I assume, made the same way each time, I expect the balance of the boxes I purchased to exhibit the same flavor as the first box I purchased from my local store.
B000C0245C1215561600 positivo A good present My friends enjoyed this present very much. The shipping cost was too expensive ...
B000EMK3V01167264000 positivo My family loves these as a side dish When I am short of time and want a fast side dish I make these and my family loves them. When I don't have time to peel, dice & boil potatoes these save the day. Teens can prepare them with ease too.We like all varieties and they taste great.
B0000DF3Z71171756800 positivo cooks, chefs, and diners These Amish products are very good and economical. I find them, used appropriately, very helpful in cooking. They seem to be clean, fresh, and very nicely made. Their deliveries are good and timely.
B000EOMUAK1180569600 positivo Best Salt You Can Buy This is hands down the best sea salt you can buy. Besides the taste, it does not have anything added to prevent clogging. Since these additives are often derived from corn, this is important to people with corn sensitivities. Despite the lack of any anti-clogging agent, the salt flows easily from the shaker. I keep a small size bottle in my purse for meals out.

B000LKZIMO1199318400 positivo Misnamed but tasty The unhappy reviewer has a point; this ramen is in no way spicy or Szechuan-like. However, it makes a great meal base, or eaten alone provided you spice it up yourself. Plus I can finally eat my favorite food without studiously avoiding the nutritional content label. Way more expensive than typical ramen, but then you pay more to avoid a coronary.
B000LKZIMO1192579200 positivo Soken low-fat Ramen I tried this product because I like ramen but not the usual fat content. This is about what I expected "good enough" I am used to a low-fat diet and I eat very little meat. It could use a little more flavoring if it were to be improved upon. Sometimes I add my own veggies to it. Overall, great product to use when low-fat is what your looking for.
B000LKZIMO1250467200 positivo I love SOKEN Ramen I think the Spicy Dragon is very good, although not that spicy, if you want something a little more spicy try the Wasabi with green tea noodles. This has been the only msg free and vegetarian ramen that I have been able to purchase in my local stores and now none of them carry it any longer. Thank god for the internet.
B000LKZIMO1197504000 positivo I'm vegan and I like it I'm vegan. I like it. It doesn't taste really salty, which is a plus for me. If you're accustomed to ramens that are loaded with tons of sodium, then you might find it less flavorful than what you are used to. If you can get past the lack of sodium, you'll be able to taste subtler flavors.
B000LKZIMO1193702400 positivo Horrible! No preservatives, no MSG, also NO flavor, and NO spice! It was like eating plain ramen without any seasoning at all. If you're a vegan and you're looking for vegan snack foods, look somewhere else. This isn't worth the money.
B000LKZIMO1239926400 negativo Inedible. Really wanted to like it. I would rather eat sticks or leaves from my yard. The noodles are awful, the broth is typical ramen broth. I bought a three cases of these because Nissin Choice ramen was discontinued at the supermarket and I wanted something a little more healthy because I eat ramen for breakfast often.I told my four coworkers I was going to throw out all the ramen and they all tried a packet. They all agreed it was the worst ramen they had ever tasted by far and wouldn't take it for free. I think I am going to donate it to the food bank, pity the homeless.
B000OWIO1G1250640000 positivo Very subtle and pleasing~ a staple in my tea experience Green Earl Grey Tea by the Revolution Tea is one of my all-time favorite teas. I make sure that I never run out.There isn't much more I can say. Top ranking as a Certified Organic, it is a light, sophisticated, unexpected, very fine tea. Try it, and I think you will appreciate the unique twist in adding bergamot to a green leaf brew. I use this tea as an aperitif, or late in the evening in place of a sweet to finish my day peacefully, savoring an unusually pleasing and calming teapot experience. Night after night, I never get tired of it. Ahhhh.....Have fun~ enjoy!
B000OWIO1G1354579200 positivo Love it! What could be more perfect? Earl Grey with the benefits of Green tea! Very subtle, light, but still has the English tea flavor. I don't buy it here, too pricey. My local bix blue box store carries it. But not every one of that store does so you might have to look around a bit. When you see it, buy a bunch!

B000HTUKKO1228521600 positivo Really Good Sugar Free Candies - Recommended! Being diabetic, I am always on the watch for sugar free snacks. The "GoLightly Hard Candy" is a great addition to my snaking list.At only 45 calories and 0 Net Carbs for 4 pieces, these do not impact my blood sugar levels or ruin my diet. These are sweetened with Splenda, so they are slightly less sweet than regular candies, but do not cause the "laxative" effect other dietetic candies can have.There are serveral types of available and they are all good!Highly recommended!
B000HTUKKO1220659200 positivo Great refreshing snack. Great for in between meals when you want a nibble. I also like one after meals for a desert. With the splenda for sweetner, it's an ideal treat for a diabetic.
B000EOMUAU1171584000 positivo BETTER IN EVERY WAY I have never used better salt. It is better tasting, prettier, and has more real salt flavor than any other salt even though you use less to get that salty taste. Other salt always gives me endema and raises my blood pressure. RealSalt does not give me endema as do other salts, and my blood pressure has even gone down rather than up. My whole family feels better. We will never use other salts again. We just finished using our first 25 # box, and love it. By the way, we have found that it pours better than other salts, too.
B000EOMUAU1204156800 positivo Great Stuff! I have filled all my salt shakers with Redmond's Real Salt. I learned about it when I was researching the pH Miracle Diet. Dr. Young taught me how important natural sea salt is to the body. I've heard others say that sea salt tastes better than refined salt, but my taste buds aren't that discerning. I just know that Real Salt is healthier than table salt and I can't tell the difference in taste.
B000EOMUAU1196899200 positivo heathy natural If you love salt, this is a natural product. I share this purchase w/family. Recommend this company and product to all
B000EOMUAU1293840000 negativo Sand in this salt This is an awful product. It leaves sand in your food and bottom of cooking pans after boiling something. Why there are so many 'excellent' reviews leaves me wondering...Who's really behind these reviews? Granted it may be "Natural & Organic" but so is dirt. I do not think there are THAT many folks who love to eat grit!
B000FPCW0Q1168473600 positivo Peanut Butter heaven This is an excellent take on an old favorite. Try the recipes includled, especially the wings, they are delicious. I probably added a bit more peanut butter (heaping tablespoons) and a dash of cayenne pepper but really good and simple to make. Look forward to trying the other flavors. Gave a few tubs away and my friends loved this item also.
B000E433ZQ1304985600 positivo A Nice Change of Pace!! I usually use the dirty rice mix without cheese. I ordered this by mistake, and glad that I did! It is easy to make as the other flavor, and tastes great! I made it for company, and ended up giving away a few boxes. Zatarain's does it again!
B000E433ZQ1287964800 neutro Best when used by date I have enjoyed Zatarain's products and, therefore ordered a number of boxes of dirty rice and cheese via Amazon's Subscribe and Save process. My problem is the items received expire in like 108 days (12 boxes). I have purchased items at local stores and the best by date are almost always at least year in advance. This shipment appears to be at the very tail end of the cycle - the items are clumpy and appear to have been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time (obviously). Ok gotta run and eat some before the expiration date!
B000E433ZQ1198627200 positivo Cheesy dirty rice isn't "cheesy" :} Cheese and rice go well together, especially with a little ground beef or sausage and spices. This is a combination that's hard to beat. Just provide the meat and it's good right from the start, or spice it up and enjoy doubly. A distinctly tasty treat.
B000E433ZQ1275696000 positivo Great rice product... Could not find this product in local stores anymore, decided to get some here. Great flavor
B000E433ZQ1243382400 positivo Very Good We love Zatarain's Dirty Rice Mix and purchase it often in the stores.I've never noticed the cheese variety before so decided to try it.It's nice and spicy and very cheesy. We were both pleased with it, but I still like the regular Dirty Rice mix better.
B000E433ZQ1361145600 positivo Many meals The great thing about this is that in one box there are at least 100 different meal possibilities to create.
B000E433ZQ1355097600 positivo A delicious side dish or you can jazz it up into a main course item! This is a great side dish so you can add in some fried hamburger, sausage or smoked sausage and make more of a main course item out of it. It is delicious and tasty and easy to fix. If you toss in 1 pound of meat it makes six servings of one cup each. You can also throw in some vegetables into the mix and we use frozen corn or small pieces of broccoli. We love the spicy and cheesy taste.I have listed below the Nutrition Data but I would like to point out that you should be aware of the sodium content as one cup contains 28 percent of your daily allowance of sodium and that does not include any meat that you might add.Amount Per Serving % Daily ValueCalories: 150Calories from Fat: 20Total Fat: 2.5g 4%Saturated Fat: 1g 5%Cholesterol: .5mg 1%Sodium: 660mg 28%Total Carb: 27g 9%Dietary Fiber: &lt;1g 4%Sugar: 4gProtein: 4gVitamin A: 4%Vitamin C: 15%Calcium: 8%Iron: 8%
B000E433ZQ1184803200 positivo family favorite My busy family with three kids needs quick meal options. Red Beans and Rice with some veggies and shrimp thrown right in is a great fast meal.
B000E433ZQ1261785600 neutro Storage problem at the warehouse? This is a good product and amazon's price is right, but there may be a storage problem at the warehouse. All of the mix in the packets is clumped. It cooks up well enough but takes some work to break the clump apart for cooking.
B000E433Z61286841600 positivo Simple and delicious I wish I could find this on my grocer's shelves! Slightly spicy, slightly cheesy, and perfect with the addition of chicken, chorizo, and/or shrimp.
B000E433Z61154995200 positivo Zatarain knows New Orleans Love this item. I usually just add 1 lb of a variety of sausages and in about 30 minutes I have a awesome New Orleans style meal. Love the taste and seasoning it perfect.
B000E433Z61325894400 positivo Wow. I mean, like, WOW! Ive been a long time user of Zatarains regular Jambalaya. I cook it up, throw in some lightly sauteed polish kielbasa pieces and enjoy in 25 minutes.That is, until I tried jambalaya with CHEESE!!They say when you've seen it all, you can die happy. Well, Ive tasted all that Ive needed to taste. I could die happy tomorrow. The jambalaya with cheese is what YOU have been missing your whole life. It is absolutely delectable. The perfecccttttt amount of cheesy, perfect amount of hint of spice, and all together - it just wreaks harmony on your taste buds.I dont think Ill ever eat regular jambalaya again - it was my favorite for years, but move over and make room for my new #1 favorite from Zatarains - Jambalaya with Cheese. Try it, you wont be disappointed!
B000C0248E1319760000 positivo Fantastic I sent this collection of Italian cheeses to my daughter and needless to say she was delighted. They were excellent!!Formaggio del Cucina (Italian Cooking Cheeses 2 pound) by igourmet.com

B0004M0GZS1186876800 positivo Delicious Ronzoni Pasta is always the most consistantly GOOD pasta. It's all i'll buy for pastas, and the quality is always consistantly good.
B000H1558E1353196800 positivo As good as it gets If the taste of nu-salt was any closer to salt, it would be salt. I have tried them all and this is way better than than the best of all the others. Especially when you're having that special something that just isn't right without salt.......ta da. MY neighbor (who is also reducing her sodium intake) had the same disappointing results from the others, and after tasting Nu-salt wanted me to order some for her on my next Amazon shopping trip.
B000H1558E1352851200 positivo Tastes just like table salt - No aftertaste This product tastes exactly like iodized salt. NO aftertaste like other salt substitutes. My mother is a diabetic who also has CHF and must take diuretics for fluid retention. This product was given to her during a hospital rehabilitation stay in Missouri and we searched high and low for it in Georgia but it is not carried in any stores. The price is great and it tastes fantastic. I use it in my salt shaker at home now and no one knows the difference.
B000H1558E1351123200 neutro disgusting, but can be used as "filler" or to spike your existing salt I gave the product itself a 3 star review because it is exactly what it claims it is, 100% potassium chloride - it comes reasonably boxed and the shaker is just... well its a shaker and it works.HOWEVERThis is NOT a perfectly acceptable salt replacement as it is, not in a longshot. The "metallic taste" is an understatement.This tastes absolutely nothing like salt to me, not even a little. What I taste reminds me of when I am using grinding wheels in the workshop and get the metal dust in my mouth... Not even salty metal dust. The metallic taste IS the taste, and it's aweful.You can use this to spike regular salt as filler, maybe up to 50/50 but probably less... but do not expect to purchase this as something you can just get used to or as something that will be "good enough"This is a great value oz to oz on amazon at it's current selling price, but plan on using it with other ingredients. I needed to increase my potassium intake on a ketosis diet so this worked as way to sneak some in and it is much cheaper than pills.
B000H1558E1350864000 neutro Nu-Salt Nu-Salt is the closest substitute product to real salt when used in baking or cooking. It is white like salt not brown....
B000H1558E1347840000 positivo Wonderful Product Have been using Nu-Salt since the 80's. You can not tell the difference from real salt. My doctor told me about it back then. Love, Love Love the product...Amazon is the only place that I could find it. If you love salt like I do then this product is for you and Amazon is the place to fine it. Thank You Amazon
B000H1558E1345939200 neutro Not great, but I'll work with it. I'm hoping this tastes better over time. There is definitely a metallic aftertaste. It is strong. Like "maybe I just ingested something I shouldn't have" strong. The effect is lessened when combined with other spices. I used a no salt blend (Kirkland brand) and added Nu Salt to give the blend a little more salty flavor. It worked OK, but not as tasty as I had hoped. I'll likely try out other similar products. If they all taste like this, then I'll just use it sparingly with heavy doses of other spices. It is definitely worth it to try to find tasty lower sodium options. Salt kills.
B000H1558E1342742400 neutro CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE USING This product was used in our hospital and had to be pulled.If you have poor renal clearance or suseptable to retaining Potassium you could have heart failure and die. I have seen this almost take 1 persons life before it was realized it was the Nu-Salt.
B000H1558E1335830400 positivo good stuff Since I have high blood pressure (controled by meds) - it was always suggest cutting down on salt (especially by my kids) - but I needed my own scare to convince me - - I found Nu-salt at Sprouts - - but couldn't find it at any other store close to me - - I loved the Nu-salt - it made the transition easier ! ! But I'm not crazy about needing to go to the store constantly - even buying two at a time still was too many trips to the store (and I really didn't shop at Sprouts too much except for that) - - so I was so glad I could buy a pack of 12 - and have it delivered right to my house - - win - win ! !
B000H1558E1339113600 negativo Waste of money I bought it for my father who just came out of rehab after stroke. Doctor told us to eliminate solt from his diet as much as we can. So I ordered Nu-Salt. This product does not even taste like salt, it tastes like an iron, very strange and unpleasant taste. People, please DO NOT buy a whole 12 pack before you taste it. I'm actually pretty amazed that people leave good feedbacks for this product which is in my case totally oposite. Try to use lemon, lime or maybe different type of salt replacement but not Nu-Salt.
B000H1558E1266451200 positivo Very pleased with Nu-Salt I bought this for my mother who is on a very restrictive diet (almost no sodium/salt allowed). She loves it and says it tastes just like regular salt.
B000H1558E1243555200 positivo Nu-Salt Product This is a low sodium product but does taste salt like and does a good job in providing a salt like flavor with reasonable use. Priced in-line with other no salt/low sodium products of similar quality in my admittedly limited experience with these type products.
B000H1558E1260835200 positivo Quick shipping, great product Excellent salt substitute, much more affordable than most brands. I mix it with about 10% sodium normal salt to produce a more normal taste and save much more money over buying "lite salt"
B000H1558E1361232000 positivo Good salt substitution Best salt substitute I have had. My mother was introduced to it while in the hospital. We had trouble finding it in stores so we ordered it from Amazon. Just did not need so many shakers in order.
B000H1558E1359417600 neutro Nu-Salt I had never tried this product before. It tastes a little different but not unpleasant and a little goes a long way!
B000H1558E1358899200 positivo Nu Salt This is the best salt tasting product that we tried with no sodium and it is priced less tnan other products.
B000H1558E1358294400 positivo Great for a potassium deficient diet. I have been tracking my eating for health and weight loss reasons. One thing I have found is that I am critically lacking in potassium to the point that I have had severe physical manifestations of potassium deficiency. I have started to change my diet but I can't get enough potassium in my diet and feel ok with the food I eat (I have Gulf War syndrome and many things my stomach does not like). I tried supplements but I don't want to waste the money on it when I can add this to my food and lower my sodium while increasing my potassium at the same time. I know this is not the main reason people start using potassium salt but this is my reason and I feel a lot better since doing it. I humbly suggest others find a food tracker like fitday or caloriecount to see what they are deficient in. Many of the issues with me are directly related to potassium deficiency.
B000H1558E1357689600 positivo Great This stuff is the greatest . I wish I Had more to say . It taste just like salt pours just like salt
B000H1558E1357430400 positivo For salt free users, you either hate it or love it I am restricting salt. That is sodium. Most people find the taste of potassium salt abhorrent. I, on the other hand, seem to be the rare person who likes the taste. I put this product on all of my foods and feel that it makes them taste better than ever. My wife finds my taste rather bizarre and cannot abide to eat anything with this product.However, for me, it works.And, the price is right.
B000H1558E1356480000 positivo Good Product and Great Price Due to heart issues I am on a low sodium diet and also take multiple diuretics that cause me to have trouble keeping my potassium levels up in the optimal range. I have been through all the various brands of salt substitutes I can find, and Nu-Salt is one of a couple that I find has the least amount of bitterness. Using Nu-Salt I have managed to adjust my recipes to work well and have also managed to make sodium free variatiions of my favorite seasonings and rubs, including seasoned salt.The packaging of the bulk pack of 12 is also very convenient. it comes in the same display box you might find on store shelves, so it keeps them neatly contained in my otherwise messy pantry.
B000H1558E1354320000 positivo Good stuff Love it! Gave some to my aunt and she loved it so much I bought her a 12 pack too!
B000H1558E1301788800 neutro Some good some bad Great to replace for cooking and sprinkling for those with hypertension (high blood pressure) since it has no sodium, but the taste/aftertaste will not be well received by all. Worth a try though.
B000H1558E1269129600 positivo Awesome Salt Substitute This stuff is an excellent salt substitute. I will continue to buy it in the future.
B000H1558E1266019200 positivo NuSalt Salt Substitute Mother in Law tried to find this at our local grocery stores, including bigger chain stores that have groceries. No one in our area carried it. Found it immediately with a search of your site!! Thank you so much!!!
B000H1558E1233273600 positivo Nu-salt This salt doesn't have any sodium chloride in it and something else in it that gives it a little tingle on the tongue.
B000H1558E1351555200 neutro Beware if you're sensitive to MSG I bought this at the health food store, and I guess I could get used to the bitter aftertaste that, as one other reviewer says, ends up in your throat, but I should have read the ingredients more closely. Even if I liked the taste, I couldn't use it because of that last ingredient "natural flavor". Not sure if you're aware, but that's one of the many aliases of Mono-sodium Glutamate, as in "Accent", and is a flavor enhancer. Many people have no known sensitivities to MSG, but I'm a lifelong migraine sufferer and have to keep an eye out for it because it's poison to my system.
B000H1558E1272326400 negativo This stuff is absolutely NASTY!! I have no idea who is submitting the 5* reviews here, but they lost their taste buds years ago.This stuff tastes nothing like salt. It has a horrible bitter after-taste that lingers in your mouth ruining anything it touches.Try it at a restaurant or something before buying it. It even nauseates in cooking or in recipes requiring any significant amount of salt.If you are on a salt free diet, find something else. Yuk! With a capital Yuk!!=============UPDATE=====================I have found one use for this. In cooking, with tomato sauce, if you mix it with real salt, you need much less salt. The tomato sauce appears to nullify the bitterness somehow. So, if you like pasta with sauce but have to cut down on salt intake, perhaps this is the answer for that.But it is NO salt shaker for the table.
B000H1558E1281571200 negativo WARNING!! You should not use potassium chloride if you have kidney failure, Addison's disease, severe burns or other tissue injury, if you are dehydrated, if you take certain diuretics (water pills), or if you have high levels of potassium in your blood (hyperkalemia). Potassium chloride may be harmful to an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Serious side effects of potassium include uneven heartbeat, muscle weakness or limp feeling, severe stomach pain, and numbness or tingling in your hands, feet, or mouth.In addition to all this scary information...product tastes horrible. Like something that is not intended for human consumption. Its bitter with a definate 'bite' and aftertaste. I would not expect anyone to use this product regardless of their health...it's that bad!
B000H1558E1305504000 positivo 150 parts KCl + 1 part Citric Acid = a good NaCl substitute This Nu-Salt product is almost entirely potassium chloride (KCl) rather than table salt, which is sodium chloride (NaCl). Potassium chloride tastes more like table salt than anything else I've tried, but it does have a bit of a metallic after taste. I've fairly-well masked that, though, by mixing 150 parts of potassium chloride with one part of citric acid crystals (also called sour salt). Citric acid has a very strong lemon flavor which is so strong by itself that it's difficult to use a small enough quantity of it. By mixing a small amount of it with potassium chloride, the citric acid flavor is much diluted, which makes it much easier to use, and the potassium chloride metallic after taste essentially disappears.EDIT: I keep changing the ratio of KCl to citric acid. Now I appear to have settled on about 1/4 of a teaspoon of citric acid per 3 oz. shaker of Nu-Salt. I think that works out to about 72 parts KCl to one part citric acid. It's all a matter of your taste, obviously.
B000H1558E1285632000 neutro A tasty, considerably healthier substitute I'm the kind of guy who has great blood pressure and no real medical conditions -- and I'd like to keep it that way. I recently started the Atkins Nutritional Approach and I'm having great success. However, as a side effect to eating healthier, the salt (and sugar, for that matter) found in most prepared foods is becoming hard to swallow -- most places simply use too much.I purchased this at a local store on a whim to see if I can balance my home cooking with the high-sodium foods found outside of my home. I never tried it before because I know a lot of people have an unpleasant reaction to it, such as a bitter or metallic taste. I'm happy to say it tastes great to me. It has the same "buzz" or "bite" as salt does, you don't need to use quite as much to get the same saltiness in foods as with Sodium-Chloride, and I experience no aftertaste or metallic/bitter flavor. It also seems to bring out accompanying flavors, such as garlic, just as well as real salt does.The only slight problem, and the reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it doesn't have an after-taste but an "after-effect". I get a very slight feeling of tightness in my throat, like when you salivate before vomiting. It sounds a lot worse than it is, because it's a very mild effect. Salt actually does the same thing to the palate, but not as strongly as Potassium-Chloride does; for me, at least.Overall an excellent substitute for a more healthy lifestyle that just takes a little "getting used to".
B000H1558E1249171200 positivo What a blessing! I was recently told by the doctor that I must follow NO SALT diet, I found this KCL in place of NaCL and it is fine! I use it mostly for recipes that call for salt, and truthfully I cannot tell the difference. I did check with the doctor, and he said that it is fine to use it.The small containers are nice, as you can easily take it with you to use when visiting, at work, at restaurants, etc.
B000H1558E1326499200 positivo Love it for its unintended use Which is for the potassium, itself. I've never used it as a salt substitute, however, although judging by the taste, you probably won't be thrilled with it unless you have a strict sodium-intake dietary restriction.This stuff is just incredible in the amount of potassium it packs in such a small amount. 1/6 teaspoon will give you a whopping 530mg of potassium. Because, by law, in the US, supplements are limited to 99mg per tablet, I didn't feel like spending all that money for pills and downing a bunch of them throughout the day (3500mg being the RDA, for potassium). I have current restriction on my food intake that make it impossible to receive the RDA of Potassium the natural way, so I needed to find a different way to get it in my system. The supplements you would otherwise have to purchase (unless you had a prescription for a higher grade from your doctor) are capped at that amount (99mg) for specific reasons that you should check out on the wikipedia entry for "potassium", if you want to be sure you'll be OK. I only take the 1/6 teaspoon at a time-4 x's a day-just to be on the safe side. I wouldn't recommend taking the whole daily allowance at one time. You'll be asking for trouble that way. I have serious cramps in both legs at times, and while I'm unable to prevent them while I'm sleeping, as soon as I feel the crap coming on, I rush to the NuSalt, place a bit under my tongue to get it in my system immediately and then dilute the rest in water and drink it. Cramp and soreness gone. Same goes with cramps after running. The Potassium works almost instantly. An inexpensive way to supplement with potassium for those who require it. Great product. Highly recommended.
B000H1558E1284076800 neutro Warning - Low Salt Substitutes are NOT always a Safe substitute for Table Salt Nu-Salt is not necessarily a safe substitute for table salt and anyone considering using it should FIRST consult with their physician. Nu-Salt, in fact, could make matters worse for some people on a salt restricted diet! Nu-Salt substitutes one salt for another salt. Table salt is sodium chloride and Nu-Salt substitutes that for potassium chloride.Now here is what the Cleveland Clinic says about this type of product (Mayo and Cleveland are generally considered the top two health organizations in the USA): "Salt substitutes are NOT a healthful option for EVERYONE. Many salt substitutes contain potassium chloride in place of sodium chloride. Potassium consumed in excess may be harmful for some people ... a salt substitute containing potassium chloride is an acceptable alternative in moderation, if you do NOT HAVE kidney problems and have checked with your physician to be sure it will not interact with any of your medications"Additional research found statements like this: "salt substitutes are low-sodium alternatives designed to taste similar. They usually contain mostly potassium chloride, whose toxicity is approximately equal to that of table salt in a healthy person ....However, various diseases and medications may decrease the body's excretion of potassium, thereby increasing the risk of potentially FATAL hyperkalemia. People with kidney failure, heart failure or diabetes should NOT use salt substitutes without medical advice. A manufacturer, Lo Salt, has issued an advisory statement"Note the reference to kidney problems, diabetes and heart failure - the three groups of people most likely to be in need of reducing their salt intake. The likelihood that this product will interact with some typical blood pressure medications is fairly high. The warning about this product possibly interacting with medications should NOT be ignored.I'll conclude with a direct quote from the Nu-Salt web site: "Please consult with your physician before using Nu-Salt."I would NOT recommend this product unless you have consulted with your physician first! It clearly takes a physician or other health care professional to decide whether this is a suitable alternative to table salt on an individual basis.
B000H1558E1291161600 positivo Best of the salt substitutes I've found Nu-Salt to be a near perfect sodium substitute. The taste is not identical to table salt but it's as close as I've found. In low/moderate quantities I seriously doubt I could tell the difference. It is a simple potassium salt, actually providing 530mg (15% DV) of potassium per serving - more than a banana. So not only are you eliminating sodium, you're also getting potassium, which lowers blood pressure (search, "potassium blood pressure"). Americans consume less than half the RDA of potassium, but by all means, if you are concerned, ask your Dr.IMO, this is as good as it gets. I like it.
B000H1558E1297987200 positivo This is as good as it gets. This is the stuff to use for a sodium free or low sodium diet. Nu-Salt gives salt like flavor to food. It is not exactly like sodium salt, but the best choice when sodium can kill you.
B000H1558E1254700800 positivo better value than No Salt, and more convenient How often can you say that a product is a better value in a SMALLER package than in a large one? Well, at $16.20 for a 12-pack of 3 oz shakers (that's about $5.40 for 12 oz of product) this product is cheaper than No Salt's larger 11 oz size for $5.75 and up. Plus, I agree with my fellow reviewers: the smaller size is more convenient for travel and dining out. The shakers close tight and can be snuck into a restaurant (or a relative's home at the holidays...!) stuffed in a pocket for use at the table. I highly recommend this product for anyone on a salt-free or low-sodium diet.
B000H1558E1303689600 positivo A credible substitute for salt on selected food Nu-Salt, which substitutes potassium for sodium, is a very satisfactory substitute for salt on many foods, but its particular use will depend on your taste. I've followed a low sodium diet for years and generally enjoy all my food without salt, even in cooking. There are a few foods, however, that cry for a salty tang: oven-fried potatoes, no-salt-added cottage cheese, salt-free vegetable juice. Judicious use of Nu-Salt really adds to these foods. I don't use it on vegetables or in baking. Family members enjoy it on different foods, but we all like it.The flavor of Nu-Salt is salty with a touch of bitterness, not that different from salt. Try it in small amounts on several foods to make your own decision. The oven-fries are great!If you're on medication or under a doctor's care, it's important that you don't use salt substitutes without checking. Very important.All in all, I think Nu-Salt is a fine product.
B000H1558E1299888000 positivo NU-SALT I have been using this product for many years. I'm very happy with this product. I would recommend this product to anyone who have to watch thier salt intake.
B000H6E62K1259539200 positivo tasted good I was looking for a chocolate bar without vanillin, and this chocolate bar had real vanilla. It tasted good, the kids liked them.
B0000V1DPK1206662400 positivo Good tea A good tea at a bulk price. It tastes good and I got enough that I can drink it fairly often without spending a lot of cash, what more can I say?You have to be careful with this tea, overbrewing will make it very bitter. I normally leave my tea in longer than recommended because I like stronger flavor, but this was a little much even for me. After about 6 minutes it starts to taste like coffee...It tastes great, but its not terribly fragrant, which is half of the appeal for me. My coworkers can always tell when I have my Earl Grey, but this just smells like mild vanilla. The string on the bag is not the strongest, and several times has pulled off the bag, leaving the bag to sink to the bottom of my vacuum flask.All in all, I'd buy it again but this might not be what I serve guests.
B000H6E62U1340236800 neutro The heat lingers Based on the other two reviews I was expecting more of a classic sweet and savory experience. My experience with these was that the spice overwhelms the sweet, while the salty is almost too faint to notice. The heat from the chili spice lasts way too long for a product advertising itself as sweet and savory. These really are more of a spiced nut than sweet and savory. If you like heat with a trail that lasts for minutes, this is your product. If you don't, try something else.
B000H6E62U1180483200 positivo Totally delicious, chic yet humorous packaging Delicious crunchy little nosh in exactly the right portion, these pecans are so tasty one might be tempted to over-indulge if the bag were bigger. Purchased on Manager's Special price so not too too pricey but this is a premium nosh, would win big points if packed in an adult foodie's lunch bag.
B000H6E62U1224633600 positivo Mashuga Nuts are the BEST! I've had other Mashuga Nuts before, but hadn't tried this particular flavor until they went on sale, in bulk. I figured if I didn't like them my family and co-workers would...They are delicious! :)(I was a little put off by the fact that the ones I received had a sell by date that was only a few months away from the time I received them. Hopefully the ones you receive won't be like this.)
B0000V1DPA1266796800 positivo A regal tea We first tried the black currant variety at a restaurant, and then ordered for home. It's top quality black tea with very unobtrusive hint of black currant. Contrary to common black currant teas, it is not acidic at all, just a very sophisticated flavor. It is distributed mostly at restaurants and rather expensive to buy, but it's so good, almost addictive.
B000NMDUWK1274313600 positivo Kit Kat Dark Chcolate (36 count) OH MY JESUS, THESE ARE SOOOO GOOD!!! They are so hard to find though, but when I do I buy a bunch because they are so tasty and perfect, way better then regular kit kats. There is just something about dark chocolate that makes everything taste wonderful. If you get a chance to try these, you wont be sorry.
B000NMDUWK1265328000 positivo Awesome candy snack Unfortunately I can't see to get these for some reason, but when I did try some samples around Christmas, they were super. I have been looking for a store that sells them without any luck. I hear I can get them from Japan, but at what price?
B000NMDUWK1264550400 positivo KitKat Dark Choclate KitKat Dark Choclate are to die for if you can get your hands on them!!!
B0005YM0AY1123718400 positivo My 22 months old love it!!!!! My daughter (22 months old) is a picky eater, and we bought this to try and she just love it..... she likes Chicken and Ravioli and Beef and Tomato Ravioli.... It has no sauce, so is mess free and she would it them all!!!!! I would recommend this to everybody!!!
B000PDESX21220054400 positivo Easy healthy breakfast. I recently lost 60 pounds. Part of the way I did it was to have the same easy breakfast of cherios with skim milk and a piece of fruit. I do it religiously and without variation. The cup makes it more convenient. I hope this doesn't sound too much like a commercial.
B000PDESX21243296000 neutro Great for large groups I get these cereals for my grandaughter's school. They are great for large groups as each is individual and not too small.
B000H6E63E1294876800 positivo It is a great energy sources! It is not very sweet also. I love this chocolate espresso Beans, compare to other products,this one has a better balance of chocolate and the espresso beans, it is a great energy sources and not that very sweet.
B000E7QYO01287187200 positivo Solid, good seeds! I am on my third batch with these seeds and they are preforming as well as others I have bought before. The blades or stalks are full and lush with great color. I use potting soil, vermicite, peat moss and azomite blend in the soil. Grows great!
B000E7QYO01278201600 negativo Very disappointed I have little luck with this seed and am very disappointed. I have tried several batches and get 10-15% yield from them. I do not know if the is old seed or what the problem is. Wheatgrass will usually grow no matter what so I gotta believe the seed is not optimal. Very expensive waste of time and money for me = (
B000E7QYO01306454400 neutro Want Wheatgrass Daily.? Buy in Bulk.! Just a note to endorse the quality and economy of this product. I have grown wheatgrass on and off for years..decided to go "all in", and add to my (protein heavy) diet daily. At approx.6oz. seed/flat, that's 65 weeks of fresh grass for $40.! The quality/sproutability of this seed far surpasses that of my local health food store.
B000E7QYO01315180800 positivo I actually sought out this seller again because of the results I had with first purchase I tracked down my invoice from a year ago so I could find this seller again, and when I found them was surprised to see the negative reviews. I bought 25 lbs in Sept. 2010 and due to personal circumstances was not able to start growing any wheatgrass until this summer. I just did two trays, with 2 cups of seed per tray, soaked and then germinated for 3 days in the dark. I had good thick trays of grass, and most importantly it was so deliciously sweet! This was my first time growing wheat grass and it smelled so strong and bitter when I juiced it-- I was concerned, thinking it would taste awful. But it was so sweet to the taste. I was later told by an old pro that some say the sweetness is due to the seed, which brings me back to why I sought out this seller again. Obviously, I can't be guaranteed that the next 25 lbs will be equally sweet since it's a year later and likely a different harvest, but I hope so!
B000E7QYO01303776000 positivo Grew thick and healthy. (See Picture) While I see that others had problems, my experience was flawless.Growth: 5 - 6 days, no sun (just room light)Density: thick (see picture that I uploaded)What's not to like?
B000E7QYO01361318400 positivo Certified Organic Wheat - 25 Lbs - For Wheatgrass Juice, Sprouting Arrived promptly with no problems. I do not use for juiceing. I raise organic chickens and grow the grass for them (winter only). Germination is excellent and the chicks just love it. For the uninformed, the grass makes for deep, rich, yellow yolks.
B000E7QYO01323561600 positivo Yum , Yum All 25 pounds arrived. Now I'm growing and grinding like crazy. I grind to make flour and I grow for juicing and for my dog. Yep! My dog loves it. He needs wheatgrass for his health too. I have not consumed the entire 25 pounds of wheatgrass yet; but what I have eaten is satisfactory. I would definitely order from this vendor again.
B000E7QYO01289606400 negativo I was disappointed, too. Very. I am new to growing wheatgrass & am very glad this was not the brand I tried first. I had been using some from healthy-eating and was quite happy with it (the only other brand I've tried so far) but decided to try this one because it is about half the price. Wish I had only bought 10 lbs. instead of 25. The grass here is very slow to grow and sparse and patchy.
B000BHI8JW1350345600 negativo Waste of money These looked wonderful and were a birthday present for a close friend. When they came the foil was all stuck to the candy. We tried to unwrap a couple and it made a bigger mess with the paper sticking terribly to the candy. In the end we were able to taste the tiniest piece which just made us more disappointed and angry since it was delicious. We would never order these again or do business with this company. And living in Florida was not the problem since we paid BIG prices for the candy and shipping, it was not hot and the package was literally put in our hands from the truck, so it didn't sit outside. Big Big disappointment.
B000BHI8JM1338681600 positivo Scott's fudge balls These were delicious, but not wrapped as well as I think they should be. They kind of melted out of their wrapping.
B000EVO1JG1327017600 positivo My kids beg me to buy these I have bought these rice/popcorm cakes for years at my local health food store and quite often they are sold out, so I am happy to see them on Amazon. I think this is the best rice cake flavor ever and other brands that once made white cheddar no longer do. My kids (19, 13, & 10) have eaten them all their lives and anytime they know I am going to the health food store they beg me to get them.
B000EVO1JG1166227200 negativo Hain White Cheddar Popped Corn Mini Cakes These are pretty bad. I had tried the mild cheddar variety and liked those quite a bit, so I bought 12 packs of each. I opened a bag of the white cheddar and was amazed at how unpleasant they tasted (didn't taste white cheddar) - now I'm stuck with 11 bags! I'll sell them to you half price!!
B000EVO1JG1157932800 positivo Crispy and crunchy like tortilla chips I was surprised by the texture of these. I thought they'd be airy and crunchy, like regular rice cakes. However, they're much more dense and crispy, like a tortilla chip. They're not as cheesey as they could be either, but that helps to keep the sodium levels down.
B000JWRY2G1324425600 positivo Extremely Pleased I ordered one of these baskets for my husbands boss's family and one for us for our Christmas Eve snack tray at our home. Ours arrived today and I must say I was thrilled with how beautiful the whole basket is. Everything is exactly as pictured with large portions of meats and cheeses plus all the mustard dips. Hubby's boss usually sends a thank you card for Christmas gifts but her's arrived today also and she called him immediatly to thank him for the wonderful gift basket, she was also impressed that it was a Nueskes's. This is one gift you will be proud to give. I will be a return customer for certain.
B000CHIJ0Y1319241600 positivo Great!! Perfect sauce pumps for caramel and chocolate, this is pretty much the only place I can get them for our coffee houses.
B000CHIJ0Y1354147200 neutro It worked well while it worked Just like my title says, it worked just as it's supposed to until it suddenly stopped working. I am ordering both 64 oz bottle and a small squeeze bottle so I could keep refilling small squeeze bottle with the big bottle.
B000CHIJ0Y1349654400 negativo Garbage Never buy this; it worked about 1 week. I will never buy that again. I can't find another similar pump yet.
B000CHIJ0Y1361145600 positivo Heavy duty This is certainly worth the money, it is easy to use and it doesn't drip sauce all over the place :)
B000EVO1KA1257552000 positivo great low-calorie healthy snack!! Hain Mini Apple Cinnamon Rice Cakes are a tasty, low-calorie and very filling and satisfying snack. Anytime you are in the mood for something crunchy, just reach for a bag of these wonderful healthy and delicious rice cakes.
B0000V1DSM1068681600 positivo Who Knew Green Tea Could Taste so DELICIOUS I recently tried this tea and was impressed from the first sip: it has a nutty complexity that does not get in the way of the satisfying, well-rounded green tea flavor. Doesn't need sugar, honey -- anything! What a find!
B0000V1DSM1178323200 positivo Nice, smooth, doesn't get bitter. I'm usually one to get bored with something and move on to new things. However, I have been drinking this tea for years (I'm still drinking it in 2010, 3 years after my initial 2007 review!!). It doesn't get bitter, unlike many other teas, no matter how long you steep it. It is balanced, sweet, and smooth all on it's own--no need for extra sugar or honey to make this a great, refreshing tea.
B0000V1DSM1152576000 positivo Doesn't get any better than this! I have tried many different flavors and types of green tea, but this is by far the most enjoyable. You can drink this all day. Such a smooth, wonderful taste. Highly recommended. Try it...you will love it!
B0000V1DSM1240963200 positivo The absolute BEST This is the only green tea that reminds me of my years in Japan. SUPERB!
B0000V1DSM1196640000 positivo Great Value--tasty and affordable Toasted Rice Green - 100 CTThis tea taste great--mild with toasted rice aroma--AND it's a great buy. If you drink a lot of green tea, this is the one you want.
B000EVO1L41274140800 positivo Satisfying, light, sweet crunch! For such a light snack, these are surprisingly tasty and satisfying. If you need a sweet to tie you over till mealtime or as a desert substitute after lunch, grab one of these and GO! Very portable, so you can eat on the go without mess or utensils. Try them!
B000CMGZFU1176163200 negativo A Disappointment! I had thought this would be full of dried fruits and nuts ( in other words, healthful) but it's really just sugar laddened bits of hard fruits and only flavorless peanut pieces. I have given the local food bank all but the one package I opened which made me feel so unwell that it's now in the rubbish. I am truly very disappointed in this product. It's description belies it's reality. If sugar is contraindicated in your diet....steer clear of this product!! It's low in salt and low in fat but so over sugared as to be actually nauseating. It's too bad because it sounded delicious and so nutritious. All I can say is YUK!!! I suggest you leave this product alone unless you think high sugar is good for you.
B000CMGZFU1177632000 negativo All the flavors of the farmer's market...if your farmer harvests only sugar... These types of fruit mixes live or die on the basis of how well the flavors in the package complement one another. The best of these kinds of things mix sweet fruit with sour or salty or chocolate or something else.Not this one. It's just cloyingly sweet on top of cloyingly sweet. There are several types of dried fruit in the bag, but there's so much added suger they all taste the same. Basically, everything is a little sweeter than normal raisins. This may appeal to the kids in your house, but the adults will want to approach this stuff with caution. You might be able to make this stuff edible by mixing it yourself with other (less sweet) things, but taken as-is you'll probably consider this mix to be almost inedible in anything but modest amounts.
B000CMGZFU1233878400 positivo great buy this was a great buy. i got it on the subscribe and save plan so i could save even more. definately worth it as a healthy snack
B000CMGZFA1211241600 positivo Stuff is great but don't buy here Cha Cha Mix is definitely tasty, but don't buy it in bulk here because it turns rancid and you can't return food to Amazon. The first few bags were super but bag five, which was still in code, tasted nasty, as did bag six. I didn't open any more and contacted Harmony and they sent me a coupon for a free bag but that doesn't make up for the eight yucky ones I'm stuck with.
B000CMGZFA1200268800 positivo Definitely spicy! If you like spicy, you'll like these.......not overly hot, but they have a nice kick.
B000CMGZFA1191196800 positivo YUMMY!! Forget any "tex mex" mix you've ever had, this stuff is BETTER! This includes your basic sesame and corn sticks, almonds and peanuts, but this adds corn nuts, pumpkin kernels and spices it up with not only chili, but lemon! Neither spice (chili/lemon) is overpowering, they complement each other resulting in an addicting and healthy snack. If you like tex mex blends, you have to try this...it is sooooo much better!!
B000CMGZFA1222905600 negativo Terrible! It as stale as it can get! Shredded Paper with someSeasoning salt would taste better!
B000HDGD8S1207353600 negativo Greasy Looks white and fluffy no dyes, but leaves your hands greasy. Is more calories than Act II.
B000HDGD8S1215820800 positivo Just like the '60s Just like the name says it harkens back to good old days when you had to mix the oil and corn in the old electric popcorn popper and then pour melted butter over it. If you want the Lite popcorn (or styrofoam pellets), this version isn't it.For an old theatre manager, this popcorn is the best!
B000HDGD8S1207526400 negativo Learned the Hard Way Why is it that every single time I purchase Redenbacher popcorn through Amazon, it's stale? It took me 3 tries to figure it out, but I won't be ordering it from them again.
B000CMGZF01197417600 neutro I have had better They are the basic sesame stick. I have had better ones but atleast they do not contain any of those yucky ingredients that are so bad for out bodies.
B000CMGZFK1207440000 positivo Yumilicious! These snax are fantastic ! Full-size berries, and lots of them. A bit sweet for breakfast, but make a great snack. Unfortunately we could not enjoy the whole case, my dog found it and ate about 8 of the pouches !
B000CMGZFK1205280000 positivo Good stuff! This is a tasty mix. Don't expect it to be too healthy, but it's better for you than candy!
B000CMGZFK1171152000 positivo great product Great product---what else can I say? While I lived in the caribbean, I ordered food since it was too expensive to buy good quality food there.
B0000V1DTG1100476800 positivo Fabulous! This is the best chamomlie tea I've tasted! I'm not a tea connoisseur, so this review won't be fancy. All I have to say is it's great. I'm hooked!
B0000V1DTG1358985600 positivo Great service Great service. It arrived on time to give as a Christmas gift. My daughter loves the product. We will order again.
B0000V1DTG1313798400 positivo Best Chamomile Tea This is the best chamomile tea I have ever had. It requires very little sugar and just tasts wonderful. I am very happy with this purchase.
B0000V1DTG1273104000 positivo best chamomile tea i've ever tasted This is a naturally sweet tea that has a very soothing effect. I recommended it to help you relax.
B000HDGD9M1181260800 negativo BAD EXPIRATION THIS PRODUCT WAS SENT WITH A SHORT SHELF LIFE AND I FELT IT WAS SNEAKY AND UNDER-HANDED, WON'T PURCHASE FROM THEM EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!
B000JK11AY1281657600 positivo Tasty authentic spanish olives Having lived in Spain for 6 years when I was younger I remember going to street markets with my family and aways buying anchovy flavored olives to snack on. They always went very quickly, we all liked them. Not a fishy taste like you would expect but very salty and tasty, these are the closest thing I've found that compare to those.
B000JK11AY1214265600 positivo Dad loves these! I purchased these olives for my dad, who first had them years ago. My cousin, who lived in Florida, would bring them when he came to Pennsylvania and my dad thought they were just great. Now Dad can enjoy them again.
B000FCGY761327449600 neutro Rhode Island Roboin I got this quickly and am looking forward to using it, but have not needed it yet. I hope it will perform as expected.
B000QEAPA01319241600 positivo Texas Tech Tailgate Party Pack This is a Christmas gift, so I personally haven't tried it, but I do like the packaging and how fast it got here. Great gift for a college kid and their room mates.
B000H7EKBQ1167955200 positivo crunchy snack in convenient 1 oz bags These are the best crackers if you like extra crunch and lots of seeds. The bags are great for portion control. The bite size crackers are about an inch square. Put on a small square of cheese and get a real explosion of taste - but be sure to have a beverage on hand, to wash it down.
B000H7EKBQ1169942400 positivo These are great! I buy these crackers at my local HEB store, although they are cheaper here at Amazon. I find them to be healthy and satisfy my need for something crunchy. They are very filling as well and easily satisfy my hunger craving. They are very hard, more so than the average cracker, but that is part of the fun! Lastly, they taste great! What more can you ask for!
B000H7EKBQ1219536000 negativo Uber Aweful! No Flavor Here... When you read the (Klassic 3 Seed) ingredients, you can't dispute that this cracker is probably healthy.... but only if you can get it down. This has got to be one of the hardest, tasteless things I've ever eaten. I even tried this with different spreads. Eating healthy does not mean you have to sacrafice taste. I don't know who wrote the first couple of reviews but I'm convinced they must be associated with the manufacturer. Do yourself a favor... keep shopping. There are many other good tasting and good for you things out there to spend your money on. Hope my honestly helped.
B000H7EKBQ1269129600 positivo YUMMY! Mimi, the Veggourmet in Virginia, turned me on to Doctor Kracker, and I can't thank her enough! These are delicious, nutritious, and addicting. Some complain because they are hard crackers, but I just find them hearty! Good for the heart and digestive system. Love them plain or paired with a spread. Terrific with soups. Love them! Thanks Mimi!Thanks Doctor Kracker!
B000H7EKBQ1264032000 positivo Great crunch, great taste, natural ingredients. A winner We got introduced to Doctor Kracker a couple of years ago when my wife found them at Fresh Market. We all love them and have bought them in plastic containers since we first discovered them. It's a guilt-free snack that the whole family can agree on. Our three kids (9, 8, and 8) all love them. The crunch is incredible, I don't think I've ever had a cracker with more impressive crunchy texture. The flavor is muted, not extravagant or overwhelming. Just simple goodness. We get this Klassic 3 Seed, and we also get the Sunflower/Cheddar and the Seedlander. Now that they are being packaged in individual servings, they are great for school lunches and handy for packing to work or anywhere else. We use Subscribe & Save on Amazon to keep these babies in stock all the time. They are also great for dips, because they are so stout you don't have to worry about them breaking off in the dip, and they are way healthier than most other chips I see laid out with dips at parties.(I also highly suggest Stacy's Pita Chips for another great, healthy, crunchy accompaniment.)
B000H7EKBQ1256688000 positivo Doctor Kracker great taste and very filling -- eat these at work a lot for energy and feeling full!
B000H7EKBQ1234137600 positivo They're greeeeeat!! My whole family loves them. They are crunchy, tasty, filling and healthy all at the same time. My teen takes them to school for a snack and I munch on them all day long.--A bit addicting though!
B000H7EKBQ1212624000 positivo Dr. Kracker Klassic 3 Seed snack These crackers truly have it all: they're healthy, organic, high in fiber, low in carbs, no added fats or oils, no trans-fatty acids. They're baked with valuable oil seeds and Omega 3 fatty acids along with whole grains and extra seed fiber.They're unbelievably crunchy and satisfying and the 1-ounce pouch provides just enough for a snack because if you bought the large container you would be left with an empty container.For once I found a snack that I believe will appeal to everybody. Try them for yourself and see if I'm not telling the truth then pass the rave review on to your friends and family.
B000H7EKBQ1206316800 positivo Delicious One of the problems with being on a low carb diet is lack of "crunch". This is the product that helps. The small package is also useful to stop overindulgence. This will be a staple in my house.
B000K5Q9WS1189468800 negativo Disappointed... I actually tried this stuff, and I can't really recommend it in good faith. It looks good in the bottle, but no cigar. It tasted like grocery pork and beans.
B000H7EKCU1253923200 neutro Healthier than other brands but not as good I am trying to make healthier choices so I tried these. Hm-m-m-mThese crackers are very dry. They do have a subtle, interesting flavor but I find them impossible to chew and swallow without adding margarine, peanut butter or something. Sort of defeats the healthier thing I'm tryng to do.Therefore I rate them so-so.They do add something to my tomato soup if I break them over the top.
B000H1ZMRS1281916800 positivo You will never go back to regular balsamic again.. This is the real deal. My husband and I visited the property and had the most amazing meal and picked up their balsamic afterwards. The real gem is the Maturo, but this will do for more every day use.Don't hesitate to pick this up - it'll change your life.
B000H7EKCA1177718400 negativo Aweful This is not worth buying. Save your money they taste like you are chewing on a piece of cardboard and tasted like it too. Flavorless
B000H7EKCA1181088000 positivo Awesome, healthy cracker I think these crackers are wonderful!! I love the individual packages as they are great for on-the-go and portion control. I am a personal trainer and recommend these to everyone. They are high in fiber, low in carbs, and have a wonderful flavor. The bonus is they are organic & don't contain processed foods...all whole grains & essential fatty acids. What more could you ask for!!
B000H7EKCA1188432000 positivo Healthy AND Yummy, too! Make no mistake, this is a 'health food'. As such, it doesn't pack the taste- popping Frito-Lay brand kind of flavor, and thank goodness! What you get instead is a wholesome "REAL" flavor. You can tell by the taste what's it's made of: healthy ingredients, the good for you stuff. I sampled it at a women's expo, and just a few nibbles was enough to make me a customer.
B000H7EKCA1325203200 negativo Can you say cardboard with cheese flavor Like the other Doctor Kracker Snack I reviewed they are as hard as a rock. Reminds me of pasteboard with cheese flavoring.
B000H7EKCA1226707200 neutro Very healthy but the flavor isn't great I ordered these and got tired of them quick. I love healthy snacks but these lacked flavor and were almost too hard and crunchy to chew. I ate them with hummus which was ok, but when I tried to eat them plain, I couldn't even get through one little pouch. Great concept but needs more spices to make them tastier and more flavorful. I am dissapointed that I wasted my money because I still have almost all of the packages sitting in my cupboard and I probably won't eat them. My dog likes them though, so maybe they will become his treats for awhile so I don't feel guilty about throwing them away.
B000H7EKCA1224115200 positivo Delicious, hearty cracker! I love these crackers. They are high fiber and low carb and remind me of a whole grain Cheeze-It. They are definitely dense and hearty so if you're not a fan of whole grain they might not be for you.
B000H7EKCA1223942400 positivo gooooood cracker! As a person who abused his body for years with chemicals, purposely and unconsciously, I have to say that this is a good snack for someone who is looking to eat healthy. I am not 100% organic, but I have changed my diet considerably over the last 8 years. Even a few friends of mine who I turned on to these crackers have had a positive take on them. Thanx for a good little snack that is good for ya.
B000H7EKCA1191542400 neutro Dr. Kracker Snack Bag, Pumpkin Cheese Dr. Kracker Snacker, Cheese Pumpkin, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)These are a little better than the sunflower seed kind. I don't know if I got a bad batch but they are a little stale this time.
B0000V1DWS1179273600 positivo Good Taste But There Is Better This is a good tasting tea, but I found that the Mango Tea from "HAWAIIAN ISLANDS TEA COMPANY" is better tasting. The flavor is bolder, in my opinion.Mango Maui Black Tea 20 Tea bags
B000CMGZIM1157932800 positivo Pumpkin pie heaven!! I love anything and everything pumpkin, whether sweet or savory it brings a smile to my fave and makes me feel warm, cozy and happy. Maybe that's why Halloween is my favorite holiday and I start celebrating it in September! Since pumpkin pie is my favorite dessert I ordered these Pumpkin Gingerlies simply because I have never had a pumpkin flavored cookie before. The beauty of the Immaculate Baking Co. is the deep flavor each tiny cookie has. Each little treat is about two bites and is satisfying and flavorful, I don't feel the need to eat a huge cookie when I can have one or two of these guys and feel my sugar cravings bite the dust!What hit me first was the spicy, tropical ginger, then the mellow buttery pumpkin, it really tastes like a mini pumpkin pie, crust and all. The flavor combination was superb, from peppery and zingy it melted into luscious, creamy milky pumpkin. These cookies are packaged in 2oz. bags that are easy to throw in my purse and take with me wherever the road leads that day. Each baggie is only 130 calories and these are so rich and delicious I feel like I am eating a whole pie and at times can't even finish the little bag. I love knowing they are all natural with no trans fats and the brand is not only eye catching but worth the consumer's time.For those who like their life a little sweet, a little spicy and definitely tasty this is the cookie for them! These were a lovely surprise but since trying few other flavors from Immaculate Baking Co I do not get surprised anymore, I know their cookies will taste great and I am never disappointed.- Kasia S.
B000CMGZIM1149206400 positivo It doesn't get much better than this ... This is yet another new favorite! I've tried several varieties of Immaculate Baking Company's cookies, and every time I try a new one, it becomes my "favorite"! This one is no different. It tastes like a "pumpkin pie" in cookie form, with a bit more "kick" than your typical pumpkin pie filling. I love the 2-oz snack bags -- otherwise, I'd be really pigging out on these. I just toss one in my book bag on my way out the door in the morning for a quick snack between classes (I'm a full-time student).Really, these are unusually good, high quality cookies. At about $.80 per pack, they're a good deal. As long as Amazon keeps stocking them, I'll keep buying them.
B000CMGZIM1159488000 positivo Delicious ! I love these little pumpkin cookies....I will give them out at Halloween and order more for myself. Great ingredients, and texture...and very pumpkin-y. I will buy again!Nancy L.
B000CMGZIM1154044800 positivo Best Pumpkin Cookie EVER I have bought these cookies from a local health food store before, and if anyone is on the fence about trying them,they should go for it. They are tender cookies with a wonderful pumpkin/ginger taste. Luckily, this is for preportioned snack bags, or else you might end up eating all of them!
B000CMGZIM1174953600 positivo Yummy These cookies are awesome. I love pumpkin and ginger; and I really love them together! I like the snack size bags. That way I don't overeat.
B000CMGZIM1163980800 positivo superb cookie! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it's an odd texture for me. It's kind of caught between being a hard and a soft cookie. It tastes great!! I love the blend of ginger and pumpkin. Sometimes, I'll bite into a small bit of a cookie that's got more ginger than others, but it's all good. Truly, the taste is wonderful, and getting 16 little bags of the morsels? Great snack bags to take to work or on the bus.
B000MON1HI1184544000 positivo The Best! The flavor of the "Kansas City " seasoning is terriffic. It is crowd pleasing. A great GRILLED flavor. Tastes like my favorite steak place!! Am terriffied that Durkee might try to change it!
B000MON1HI1303689600 neutro This is the same as......... I called Spice Advice at 800-247-5251 and they told me that this Kansas City Steak, Weber (or Tones) Canadian Steak, and Grill Creations - Grill seasoning are all the same.However, if you are not convinced and want to order this under the Kansas City name, you can get it through diversified distributing (the distributor for Tones, Durkee, etc).I cannot verify that these are all the same. This is just what I was told.
B000MON1HI1308268800 positivo Best grilling spice in the world. I love this spice! It is coarse, flavorful and works on every meat. Walmart used to carry it and now it is only available through a vendor on Amazon. It is pricier than it was in the store but it is well worth it. I have tried others with the same like ingredients but they don't have the same boldness. Don't waste your time on others, spend the money and buy it!

B000MON1HI1297468800 positivo Best Steak Seasoning Ever This is the best steak seasoning I've ever found in a store. I've established a great reputation for my steaks based on this seasoning. Unfortunately my local grocer stopped carrying it! I am worried I won't be able to find it any longer. It really is the best!!
B000MON1HI1266624000 positivo Not just for steak! This is the best seasoning! I use it on chicken, salmon, hamburgers, sauteed squash and zucchini...it's the best and my family loves it!
B000MON1HI1356220800 positivo YAY! My husband's favorite steak seasoning, but hard to find in the grocery store. Glad I found it here--now he's happy!
B000EDHXJO1293408000 neutro Coleslaw dressing by Hidden Valley I have been having this sentfor many years from Seattle by my sister who lives threre, I find it fantastice where I want to put it on salads. If I am able to get it England that would be wonderful Obviuosly I would want to know the price and cost of sending it to me before I ordered it. It has helped me to lose over 60pounds in weight as I have it on my salads

B000H7EKD41190592000 positivo Yummy If you're trying to replace junk food with something with some protein, fiber and snack a little smarter... these are deliciously nutty, sweet and salty and they have a satisfying crunch! They're also more filling than the average one ounce snack! They're yummy with a mozzarella cheese stick.
B000H7EKD41206748800 positivo Great Healthy Snack All of the Dr. Kracker products, especially the 1 ounce single serving bags, have a great taste and are healthy for you. The taste alone is sufficient reason to purchase, being heart healthy is an extra added bonus!
B000H7EKD41262995200 negativo bleh well, they don't taste like anything... and they're really hard to bite into - not crispy, just really hard. If you're a sailor from the eighteenth to ninteenth century and you're used to "ship's biscuit", then I'm sure you will love these as they've got more protein and better taste, and are also in nice sealed packages (no weavils!) They remind me of Woody Allen's line, "I could make a lot of money selling these in a health food store."I went for these because of all the rave reviews, and I am now dissapointed. I guess I can feed these to my boyfriend... he might eat them if he's really hungry and there's nothing else.
B000H7EKD41252368000 positivo Good but hard. Just add juice. These are very good but hard. I have a soft mouth so I add a little juice or tea and wait 10 minutes. They soften up very well.
B000H7EKD41251158400 neutro One of the best crunchiest and healthist cracker ever Doctor Kracker offers several varieties of crackers, but "Sedlander" is my favorite. It has organic pumpkin seeds, organic poppy seeds, organic sesame seeds and many other organic seeds. They are made with organic whole grain spelt flour. The small bag has 5 grams of protein and 3 grams of dietary fiber. This is a great substitute for unhealthy 'other' crunchie snacks. The case package of 24 one ounce bags makes the puchase very economical, especially with free shipping.
B000H7EKD41240444800 positivo A healthy snack that doesn't taste like twigs. Pros: portion controlled bags of 120 calories3 gr. of fiber5 gr. of proteinAlmost all the ingredients are organic220 mg sodium - not bad and the crackers are not that salty tasting4.5 gr. fatPlenty of crunching satisfactionCons: can't find anyThese taste great alone or if you like, for an additional 35 calories, spread them with a wedge of Laughing Cow Light cheese spread. Personally, I love 'em with butter (not exactly a low fat, healthy option, I admit).
B0000DB0ET1358035200 positivo The Real McCoy Mustard Sauce is VERY tasty......and unlike any sauce I can buy in NY. I discovered this sauce when I went to Charleston, WV to see a pharmacy school with my son. It doesn't taste like any sauce I can get in Syracuse, NY. It's mustard based which I'm partial to. I used it to make home made chicken tenders.....I dipped the chicken in the the mustard sauce and rolled in panko crumbs...it's delicious. I hope Amazon gets this sauce in stock!
B0000V1DY61068681600 positivo This tea is wonderful!!! I first tried this tea after dinner at a restaurant in Napa and was instantly hooked. It is wonderfully fragrant and delicious and I'm not typically a big tea drinker. The only place I've been able to find it was a Dean and Deluca in Napa - quite a drive from San Jose just for tea. I'm thrilled to see it available on Amazon!!
B000GGQ50W1194998400 positivo EXCELLENT! These are very good & super fresh. Highly recommended for any & all nut lovers. The salty & sweet plus the perfect crunch make these hard to beat.
B000GGQ50W1241913600 positivo So good they're dangerous! Man, you could just sit there behind a computer and much away a whole tin of these over the course of a few hours, and that's a lot of fat! So, these are so good I'd say that if you're trying to lose weight I'd stay away unless your doing about 5 miles a day on a treadmill, and then you'd still better have some discipline and just put...the...tin...away after a while. Man these are good!
B000GGQ50C1300406400 negativo Disappointing I've never asked Amazon for a refund. This was a first. I read the reviews. All gave high ratings. My experience differs. Yes, the cashews are jumbo, in fact they're huge. However, they lacked flavor and many had a harder, more brittle texture then I'm use too. Oh well back to Planters.
B000GGQ50C1325980800 negativo Not worth the price I purchased this tin of cashews knowing it was 3.8 times the price of Planters cashews(per ounce). I was expecting a big richer taste and they were anything but. I don't understand the price because there's no reason to go back and buy more being that close to the industrial grade Planters in taste. I bought them for my wife and she said simply, "don't do that again".
B000GGQ50C1316217600 negativo Average at best Was expecting much better quality. A slightly stale taste with a minimum amount of sprayed on salt. Very disappointed with the nuts. If it wasn't such a hassle I would try for a refund.
B000GGQ50C1304812800 positivo Quality Cashews I left reviews on some other nuts online. I stock up on nuts to have around the house and, with the benefit of Amazon, appreciate buying quality. These are quality jumbo cashews. Can't go wrong with them. I didn't rate 5 stars because, afterall, it's just a cashew! - but they are good ones.
B000GGQ50C1256860800 positivo The BEST These Virginia Diner cashews are the best ever. So fresh and huge, no little pieces. Great for suprise company! The can is empty quick. Stock up for the Hoildays, makes a great hostess gift.
B000GGQ50C1193529600 positivo TOP QUALITY AT IT'S BEST! These are soooooo good! I ended up eating the entire tin myself before hubby even got any. Oops:-O LOL BEWARE: These cashews are highly addicting!
B000GGQ50C1171238400 positivo These are great! Full of flavor, all whole cashews. I have tried nuts from other vendors and they just do not stack up to these babies. They are huge and they taste wonderful!
B000GGQ50C1168819200 positivo Jumbo is an understatement They were great, my groom is a huge cashew fan as is my mom and both were more than pleased. They are not heavily salted at all, we were pleasantly surprised, the salt is more of a fine powder than what you would expect from a salted product. They always live upto having the best peanuts in VA, we send them to people all over the country and they are all hooked!
B0000V1DYQ1351814400 positivo BEST TEA EVER! This is my family's favorite tea - smooth, sweet, and just enough zing from the licorice to make your tongue tingle even after you swallo!
B0000V1DYQ1339977600 positivo No sweetener needed I first had this tea in a restaurant, immediately I tasted the natural sweetness of this tea. It was not a bitter tea,nor was it too sweet. It was like the perfect cup of tea.
B000GGQ5021326758400 positivo Good and tasty! The item was received before Xmas as planned. :-) I was impressed by that alone. They tasted awesome. I would purchase again!
B000GGQ5021323388800 positivo excellent This is the 2nd order for me. I give one can as a gift and keep the other for me. Great chocolate and good almonds. I think this is supposed to be good for you.
B000GGQ5021197158400 neutro Not As Expected Chocolate is not smooth nor shiny over almonds. Taste all right. Not a thriller.
B000GGQ5021181692800 positivo Very good, nice gift... These taste good and are a nice gift as the tin is nice and big. The chocolate coating was good but could have been a little thicker. The double dipped peanuts by Virginia Diner are better due to the thicker chocolate coating on them but these almonds are also very good. I would buy them again.
B000GGQ5021177027200 positivo delicious! These were absolutely delicious. I bought them as a treat for my co-workers, they disappeared very quickly. We couldn't stop eating them and will be ordering them again. They are not shiny covered almonds like we were expecting, rather they are hand dipped in a LOT of very good chocolate and have drizzles over the top and a flat bottom edge. Very fresh taste.
B0000V1DYG1358121600 positivo Love it Very nice combination of spices. Have orderered it for years. This is a new package but same recipe. Is unchanged.
B0000DB0GH1071187200 positivo Excellent Sauces and Salad Dressings If you are looking for something new - You have to try this! I have been cooking everything with the Zest Sauce and the Real McCoy Mustard Sauce. The salad dressings are really tasty as well. No more same old same old. I am going to send this as gifts this year to all of my cooking friends.
B0000DB0GH1071014400 positivo zest sauce has tons of uses!! I have been using zest sauce for years...so glad to see it on Amazon...it will be easy to get!I love it on grilled chicken. Mix about a 1/4 cup with fresh orange juice and rosemary. Also great on fish like this. It is also great in pasta salad.
B0000DB0GH1070236800 positivo Great flavors for a variety of foods I can't tell you how often we use these products. Seems that just about every food (and drink) item we prepare can be enhanced by one of these Appalachian Mountain Specialty products. The Zest Sauce is good on just about everything and can really make a great Bloody Mary. I love the Mustard Sauce in my tuna salad. The recipes just get you started!
B0001VWCTK1274659200 positivo Very pleased I am very pleased with this purchase. I also bought the pink, black, green, & (sczhuan?) peppers.I am most please with the white ones. The pink were very unique, but not worth the extra money (or hassle, i hate that it doesnt work with a peppermill)hmm, what else...oh and shipping is EXPENSIVE. Might as well get a few bags, just make sure to use them within a few years..

B000LRFXAE1309305600 positivo More than "just water" A little less than 5 years ago, I traveled through Romania and Moldova. Of all the things that I fell in love with (and became a necessity during my trip), the different brands and locations of bottled water was one of them. After all, the region boasts a number of famous spas and springs. Anyway, this particular water is a little more salty tasting than other carbonated mineral waters, but is really enjoyable, smooth, and worth trying. Personally, I prefer it to some of the other more easily found sparkling waters that taste a little harsh and bland.
B0002DF0I21346112000 positivo Best espresso THis is the best espresso I ever had at home. I enjoy a double shot of home brewed espresso several times a week. This is by far the best, reminds me of my 2 weeks in Italy last fall. Shopping on line from Gustiamo was easy, and the product arrived the next day from regular delivery. Can't wait to order again!!!!!!!!
B0002DF0I21334620800 positivo Great tasting coffee!!! This coffee has a distinct flavor that is delicious! Ever since I tasted it I don't want to drink any other brand.

B000ESWFHE1249516800 positivo DELICOUS AS ALL OF THEIR PRODUCTS, THIS IS ALWAYS FRESH AND OF GOOD QUALITY. I HAVE TRIED GROWING MYSELF BUT IT IS NEVER THIS GOOD! AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT FOR THAI COOKING.
B000ESWFHE1352937600 positivo LEMONGRASS LOVER So, I placed my order Oct.30. They arrived in my mailbox 10 days later,very appropriately wrapped and in good health. I was very surprised to find that they came directly from Thailand to my home in Florida. Whenever I travel overseas I like to sneak cutting or seeds in my suitcase and worry about getting caught by immigration who hate for us to import vegetation. Apparently customs passed the lemongrass without any problems!!! Yeah!!Anyway, as soon as they arrived I unpacked the 8 stalks and stuck them in water. Today is 5 days later and all of the stalks have started to sprout!!!!I am so thrilled with this and look forward to seeing the fresh leaves pop out from the top. I plan to plant these so I can enjoy a lifetime of this wonderful fresh, therapeutic herb. Thanks Franz Market for a job well done and for making me a happy little camper :) GOD BLESS!
B000ESWFHE1347494400 positivo Lemongrass I soaked the stalks in water for about a week and planted them once they started to root. They look and smell very good. I have more than enough lemongrass now.
B000ESWFHE1287100800 neutro when a lot is too much The lemon grass was too much for me to use at one time. I don't know if I could freeze it. I wasn't too thrilled with the look of some of it.
B000ESWFHE1356825600 positivo Thai Fresh Lemongrass - 8 stalks Exactly what I wanted, will reorder when I run out. Came fresh and makes the best tea. Thank you very much..
B0001VWCUE1270684800 positivo YES, INDEED! These are great! I use them to make my own Southern-style hot sauce by putting 12 whole peppers in a blender, along with red wine vinegar and some freshly ground organic salt. Let me put it this way: I don't buy hot sauce in the stores, anymore!
B000I1U9FW1180396800 positivo Great price and taste. Bought these with an extra price off deal offered on the site. The coffee workes great in my Senseo machine and tastes as good as the higher priced coffee pods I have gotten at other places.
B000I1U9FW1179792000 positivo Good Coffee Good coffee for the price. It's much the same as Douwe Egberts at a lower cost. These same coffee pods sell for half the price in Europe, but then again, the U.S. dollar isn't worth much anymore!
B000I1U9FW1179360000 positivo Decent cup of coffee We enjoyed this coffee. These pods don't make the best mocha you'll ever have, but they are pretty good. Gala pods are definitely comparable to Senseo in quality, although a much better deal when I purchased them.
B000I1U9FW1199750400 positivo Good Coffee for a Good Price As usual the Gala brand of coffee pods deliver a good flavor for a reasonable price. Mocha flavored coffee is a nice change. Try it you will like it too.
B000I1U9FW1190678400 neutro Not equal to Senseo Coffee by any measure... I had high hopes for the Gala Brand, however now after trying the Dark Roast and the Mocha I find both to be just average coffee and no competition for the Senseo or even the Archer Farms which I find the best for the Senseo Machine.The coffee is a bit burnt in the roast and brews up weak in comparison to the other brands, do not try to get 12oz from any of these pods, the liquid will run clear after 6oz per pod.Price is great if you like weak coffee or using twice the pods for your travel mug in the morning...As the old adage goes, you get what you pay for, and even though from Holland these are not re-packaged Senseo pods as some lead to believe!
B000I1U9FW1187136000 positivo Gala coffee pods Gala coffee pods are a good buy for those who own Senseo and Melita pod coffee machines. The price is right and the taste is superb!
B000I1U9FW1178928000 positivo Still Looking I have been looking for my "everyday" coffee in a pod to use with my B&D Home Cafe, and although the Mocha is very good, not what I am looking for right now.
B000NUBCNQ1281484800 positivo Izze Sparkling Blueberry Soda I love izze sparkling soda, they are so tasty and refreashing. This one does not really have a blueberry taste but that is a hard flavor to mimic so for the flavor that this soda did taste like it was very nice. It taste alot like the blackberry only more tart, I like it but pomegranate is my favorite so far from the flavores that I have tried.
B000NUBCNQ1260489600 neutro not their best Izze sparkling juices are generally pretty good. This one, unfortunately, is not. All I can taste in it is apple juice.
B0001VWCUY1270684800 positivo YES, INDEED! These are great! I use them to make my own Southern-style hot sauce by putting 12 whole peppers in a blender, along with red wine vinegar and some freshly ground organic salt. Let me put it this way: I don't buy hot sauce in the stores, anymore!
B000MS68P61315785600 positivo Intense almond flavor Very good for baking. A little goes a long way. Do not get on skin, so intense it burns. There is no harm done.
B0001VWCUO1270684800 positivo YES, INDEED! These are great! I use them to make my own Southern-style hot sauce by putting 12 whole peppers in a blender, along with red wine vinegar and some freshly ground organic salt. Let me put it this way: I don't buy hot sauce in the stores, anymore!
B0001VWCU41274659200 neutro Very pleased I am very pleased with this purchase. I also bought the pink, black, green, & (sczhuan?) peppers.I am most please with the white ones. The pink were very unique, but not worth the extra money (or hassle, i hate that it doesnt work with a peppermill)hmm, what else...oh and shipping is EXPENSIVE. Might as well get a few bags, just make sure to use them within a few years..
B0005YMW5M1358035200 positivo The best chips available plus no shiny finger syndrome I am a tortilla chip gourmet and can vouch for these as being the best out there, meaning the various brands I tried in several supermarket chains, especially for those who want to consume the fewest fat grams possible. You will find you no longer have "shiny finger syndrome" after eating them.
B0005YMW5M1344124800 positivo Good Chip I had been looking for a low-fat chip to go with non-fat salsa for a long time. These are wonderful. Not too salty, not too bland, and way crispy. Just perfect in every way!
B0001WXTK01186272000 positivo better than expected Tasted better than I expected. Pretty low calorie too. I eat these at work when I'm too busy to walk down to the microwave. Heats well - just pour water on the pad in the box. Comes with soup which I've never eaten but the cookies are good.
B0001WXTK01220918400 positivo tastes good, convenient I bought these meals for my son in the Army. He keeps Kosher and never has enough to eat without supplements. He loves that they are low cal, tasty and convenient. Also, Amazon has best pricing by far.
B0007IQQUS1341273600 positivo meets my son in law's approval I keep this strength on hand for my coffee connoisseur son-in-law. He voices his approval , stating that it is strong, flavorful and not bitter. I have used it for iced coffee, and it has been excellent for that because I use a lot of milk, yet like to get the coffee flavor.
B0007IQQUS1329782400 positivo Wake me up! I love this coffee as a wake me up in the morning. It has a deep dark bold flavor that I love. I like my coffee strong and this fits the bill.
B0007IQQUS1325635200 positivo Not for the Faint of Heart So far, my absolute favorite K-Cup flavor...bold and a hint of burnt/bitterness, awesome flavor (even at the large cup size) and bite. Will put hair on your chest in 5 seconds flat. If you prefer mild or weaker roasts, stay far, far away.Has become my go-to flavor!
B0007IQQUS1152230400 positivo Give me my soul back This coffee is extreme. It has taken hold of my soul and will not return it.
B0007IQQUS1223164800 positivo One of our two favorite K-cups! We've owned our Keurig b70 for 6 months now (click on my other reviews to see how much we love our Keurig!), and my husband LOVES a strong coffee. There are two kinds of K-cups that we keep ordering - Green Mountain Extra Bold Dark Magic and Tully's Kona. I brew on the smallest drip size to make my own Iced Caramel Macchiato! You need a strong K-cup to stand up to the ice.I only wish that Amazon had this K-cup permanently in stock!!
B0007IQQUS1288137600 positivo Great Coffee This brand is a little pricey but it is worth it. The flavor is there and it does not taste watery like some others (Timothy brand)
B0007IQQUS1269388800 positivo Best Bold K-Cup Wife and I both love this coffee! Jet Fuel is our 2nd choice but this one is our clear favorite. After looking around the new and on Amazon, at the time of this review this is the best price (under 10 bucks) around for the Dark Magic K-Cup. Make sure you don't get this confused with Timothy's Midnight Magic when searching, the Dark Magic is much better.
B0007IQQUS1294790400 negativo too strong & bitter I purchased this based on the good reviews I read from others. I like a nice strong cup of coffee, but after drinking this I am now aware that there is a whole other level to "strong coffee"! I know this may not sound too pleasant, but the only way I can describe the flavor is that it taste like the bottom of an ashtray. No, I've never tasted an ashtray! But if one could imagine what an ashtray taste like, it would be this coffee. I know all those who gave this rave reviews probably want to shoot me, but I think it is only fair that anyone contemplating this magic extra bold coffee, needs to be prepared for possible disappointment. Since we had a whole box to use up, we tried making it several ways - larger cup size, to help weaken it, flavors, extra cream & sugar...no matter what we did, we could not get that bitter flavor off our tongues! :(
B0007IQQUS1280966400 positivo This brew is an eye-opener I usually save this K-cup for those mornings when I drag myself to work half-asleep. It's full-bodied, extra bold in flavor, yet not bitter, and is perfect with a little chocolate syrup or chocolate stevia mixed in. And the end result is I'm wide awake after just one cup of this fabulous flavor.
B0007IQQUS1151884800 positivo Best Keurig Coffee My friends say that I'm a coffee snob. Though, I admit that I drive out of my way for good coffee. This is the best Keurig coffee. Take my word for it.
B0007IQQUS1151884800 positivo Black magic I'm a Keurig newbie and have sampled many delicious blends and coffees. I can appreciate a darker richer blend and Green Mountain's Dark Magic Extra Bold Coffee is worth it's weight in gold or black magic! Perfect in the morning!
B0007IQQUS1358812800 positivo Great coffee I bought this coffee for myself because I love strong, bold coffee and this fits the bill! It's delicious coffee and the price was good.
B0007IQQUS1347580800 positivo Very Good, But Not the "Kick" I'm Looking For There's no doubt that Green Mountain's Dark Magic K-cups make extremely good cups of coffee. It's just that I don't think it packs that much of a punch. The finest espresso K-cup I've tried so far is GM's Espresso Blend. I like my extra dark coffee to have a little bitterness to it. That quality makes me know that it's strong, and Espresso Blend has it. Dark Magic is lacking that "something extra." I think the word "sweet" in the product description is the culprit here. Either way, I'd still recommend these to anybody, but Espresso Blend is the best espresso-like coffee to date.(Note: I have 3 varieties that I've never tried coming in the mail: Black Tiger, Double Black Diamond, and Revv. It's highly possible that one of those could unseat Espresso Blend. Can't wait to find out!)
B0000DB0IL1071187200 positivo Great Salad Dressings!!! If you are looking for something new - You have to try this! The salad dressings are great! I love the Wilted Lettuce Dressing...it reminds me of home! Also, I have been cooking everything with the Zest Sauce and the Real McCoy Mustard Sauce. No more same old same old. I am going to send this as gifts this year to all of my cooking friends.
B000EDHXO41322956800 positivo Finally A Good Store Brought Rub This is so good I actually brought several bottles to always have on hand. I have tried others that were ok, but not great. Either they were too salty, peppery, or too much of the ole brown sugar, and nothing in between. I made countless rubs at home that were ok, but not like KC. If I could find out the exact proportions via the Internet I would make up a huge batch.I have used this rub on chicken, pork, fish and shrimp and it is wonderful. It is not in your face over powering if you get heavy handed applying the rub. I brought one rub, put it on, and after I cooked the meat, I had to literally wash off the rub.Some rubs work well with say chicken, but not fish.The slight golden color makes the food look appetizing. I have made rubs that turned dark brown, red, and even black, not exactly eye candy.I like to grill and smoke and this takes all the hassle and guess work out of what rub to use on what.My wife isn't keen on rubs, but this one she likes.
B000EDHXO41361318400 positivo Masterpiece Seasoning MY wife stumbled upon this seasoning a long time ago and now many think i am a Chef. Happy to have found this Masterpiece in bulk.
B000EDHXO41358985600 positivo Best dry rub I buy this by the case from Amazon because it is hard to find in grocery stores. This is a must have for my barbecue ribs. If you like KC Masterpiece sauce you really need to buy this dry rub. It's perfect for chicken and ribs.
B000EDHXO41319846400 positivo Awesome product! MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BEEN USING THIS SEASONING FOR ABOUT 3 YRS NOW. WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. IT IS THE BEST ON EVERYTHING. WE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT NOW. WE RECENTLY MOVED OVER SEAS AND CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE SO WE ORDER IT FROM AMAZON BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY COMPANY THAT WILL SHIP IT HERE. THANK GOODNESS FOR AMAZON!
B000EDHXO41290384000 positivo An AWESOME addition to my cooking... This has quickly become one of the "staple" seasonings I keep in my spice cabinet.It is wonderful. I use it on all meats - grilled, oven baked, roasted....it really is one of the best! Only downfall...you have to use ALOT of it to get the best results.I buy mine from Big Lots for 2 dollars each.
B000EDHXO41287532800 positivo Best Multi-Purpose Grilling Seasoning/Dry Rub money can buy I use this on all meats (beef, pork, turkey, chicken, etc.) when I'm grilling and not using BBQ sauce.I rub it on the raw meat just before putting it on the grill.It also has much less salt than other similar grilling seasonings, but is better tasting than the ones with no salt.I recommend it for both indoor and outdoor grilling. I think it would work well for baking also, but I have not tried that way yet.My wife and I have tried several different types of seasonings (including higher priced ones found in small specialty stores that make their own in small batches), but we keep coming back to this one because it has the best flavor.I highly recommend it. We now buy it on Amazon because we can't find it in stores.
B000EDHXO41286841600 positivo A great flavor for meats of all types I use this spice for all my Chicken, Beef and Pork preparations, BBQ or baked. My family and everyone who tries my meat dishes love it. I buy it buy it here the dozen.
B000EDHXO41277337600 positivo Masterpiece is a Masterpiece Unusual to learn our local super markets no longer carry this product. It clearly is superior to any competing brands so it must be a pricing/discount vendor issue. Whatever, Amazon has it handy and my clan loves it so I use it all the time. The Masterpiece Steak Seasoning is also a 5-star product that's much better than all the other steak rubs.
B000EDHXO41249689600 positivo great for ribs found this for the first time in gold beach ,or three years ago. couldnt find it in the westpalm beach area, so i buy it by the dozen an give it away. great stuff.
B000HDGDA61188604800 positivo Great Bargain with Amazon offer I saved a LOT with the Amazon special offer. Popcorn is a favorite evening snack at our house, but I usually buy the "cheap stuff" with poor popping results. There's never a problem with Orville Redenbacher and the Smart Pop variety suits my diet requirements for fat content.
B000IMOW4K1210464000 positivo Happy Happy Happy I purchased these tasty morcellas from La Tienda a year ago for my husband's birthday as a surprise. With shipping costs added I thought it was expensive for just a couple of links but it was so worth it. I ordered the two kinds offered (with onions and with rice). You can't go wrong with fried morcellas served with hot sauce, crackers and a cold beer. My husband is already hinting at getting another order.
B000EGM52Q1265241600 positivo Great gift! These were purchased as a gift during the holiday season and went over very well.
B000EGM52Q1229644800 negativo They canceled my order! I ordered this as a Christmas gift on 12/13. On 12/19 I received an email that they canceled my order, the end. No explanation, nothing. (Other than my card would not be charged) I had to pay expedited shipping somewhere else to get a gift delivered by Christmas. Extremely unprofessional business practice to wait so long on the notification of cancellation.
B000EGM52Q1215820800 positivo sooo good they are so good, melting yummy chocolate with a kick of sweet tarty cherries. i have bought so many boxes of these for myself its unreal.
B0007IQQV21210204800 positivo Keurig Green Mountain coffee, Nantucket Blend A very nice coffee; not overly strong and with nice flavor. The Green Mountain line of coffees are a good choice for the Keurig System.
B0007IQQV21164672000 neutro Nantucket I have a B60 and only brew the small cup size, because the large size makes the coffee seem watered down. This is problem with all the KCUPS I've tried. I did purchase a large selection of the Green Mountain coffee and I really like Lake and Lodge and Dark Magic. I prefer the stronger blends over the milder flavored choices.
B0007IQQV21152057600 positivo Smooth Cup of Coffee The Nantucket Blend is one of my favorite k-cup coffees that I've made. It's a medium blend coffee that tastes great with flavored creamer or just regular creamer or milk. I will definitely buy more of this one.
B0007IQQV21276128000 neutro Warm Brown Water That's what my mother said, and she doesn't even like strong coffee! We got her a Keurig machine for Christmas, and so far have had fun trying the various K-Cups. Mom is leaning towards Wake-Up Call as an everyday coffee, and my wife and I (who drink Jeremiah's Pick Fogbuster or Longbottom Black Gold as our morning cup) think that's good, too. So, to keep this short, Nantucket Blend doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't have much flavor. If you like your coffee very mild/weak, you might love it. If you like stronger, bolder, darker blends, forget about it.
B0007IQQV21230681600 neutro Bland weak coffee I got a box of this when i bought mt Keurig coffee maker. Unfortunately, i think this particular blend of coffee is weak and has a watery taste. I even tried a small (6 ounce) brew size for this, and it was a little better - still not great.
B0007IQQV21217894400 positivo great product K-Cup Fast, great service, excellent product.Love the one cup serving, and lots of coffee choices. No more wasted coffee.
B0007IQQV21141776000 neutro Very good coffee for the k - cups I would rate this coffee as medium strength, not bitter, but good coffee taste.
B0007IQQV21138492800 positivo Love this coffee! This is my favorite of all the k-cup coffee I've tried since buying my new Keurig coffee maker in Nov. 2005. It's got great flavor and is smooth to drink. It's the only kind I'm buying at this time!
B0007IQQV21175990400 positivo Tastes the way coffee should taste This was the first coffee I sampled from my Keurig coffee maker. The flavor is nutty and mild without the acidity of many drip coffees. I am not a fan of the bold, strong coffees and prefer the milder blends. This is a great early morning coffee to enjoy with your breakfast. While you can order it on Amazon, I've found it for a better price on another website provided I buy 4 boxes of 25 K cups at a time. However, I can mix and match other flavors and brands to get the 4 boxes.I like flavored coffee as well so in addition to the Nantucket, I also recommend the Southern Pecan and Wild Blueberry. I like to brew a cup of the blueberry just to make the room smell like blueberry cobbler. Also check out Gloria Jeans K-Cups, French Vanilla, 25-Count Box (Pack of 2) if you like flavored coffee.
B0007IQQV21233187200 positivo Amazingly wonderful coffee! I love this Nantucket Blend coffee by Green Mountain and will continue to stock my kitchen with it! It is not too strong, not too weak, just right.
B0007IQQV21204329600 neutro Nantucket Bland !! Well it's not a bad cup of coffee, it just isn't very interesting. It is reasonably smooth, low acid, slightly nutty, very slightly bitter, low on oils, slightly plasticy (which all of the K-cups are). It reminds me of a weaker version of Dunkin coffee, and that's on the second to smallest setting on the Keurig, anything larger and it's tea. I haven't found my favorite K-cup yet, but the search is half the fun.
B0007IQQV21338681600 positivo One of My Favorites It's interesting how different people perceive coffee. Some here thought it was watery and tasteless, while others love it. As for me, it has a nice taste, somewhat mild, and not bitter at all. It diesn't leave an aftertaste as some do and isn't over-powering. This is my choice to drink alone without any food. I think cookies or biscuits or whatever would over power it. When I have my coffe with food I choose a stronger roast. So for a late morning or mid afternoon cup, or a cup at my desk, this is just right. For breakfast something stronger would be better.All that said, I can almost always find these K cups much cheaper at my local stores than at Amazon.
B0007IQQV21331424000 positivo Good Coffee in the morning. After loosing my husband, making a full pot of coffee was such a waste. I read about your "one cup" coffee maker. Decided to try it and I am so glad I did. Now there is coffee ready in short time and there are no leftovers.Vonda Singleton
B0007IQQV21272758400 positivo A New Household Favorite I bought this because my boyfriend likes Green Mountain coffee, but had not tried this blend before. He loved it so much, he requested I buy it every time we get new K cups! It is perfect for breakfast wake up, and even smells good to me, a non-drinker of coffee!
B0007IQQV21241654400 positivo Green Mountain Nantucket Blend K-cups I recently bought a Keurig coffee maker, and this blend of coffee was my first to try on the coffee maker. It's very tasteful, and I will continue to drink it.
B0007IQQV21222473600 neutro Wishy Washy I wouldn't consider myself a coffee connoisseur, but I do know what I like and this is not it. I found this coffee weak and watery. I ran it in the smallest cup size that my machine makes and it was still weak.I will admit that the flavor wasn't bad, but there just wasn't enough of it. It tasted like I got a half packed cup. This was one that came as a sample with my Keurig system. I normally prefer French Roast, Sumatran Reserve, Dark Magic - you know something with a kick. But even the Breakfast Blend that I purchased had more flavor. Suffice to say this should be very low on your list if you want something that has a reasonable volume of flavor.
B0007IQQVC1191974400 positivo Very dark and rich. Great blend, if you like French Roasts you will love this. I have found the best K-cups for the Keurig are the dark roasts, they seem to brew with the best flavor, and as far as they go this is one of the best. You won't go wrong choosing this if you love a dark, rich, full bodied flavor with a little bite like I do.
B0007IQQVC1258243200 positivo The Best I've Had I've tried most of the K-Cup flavors out there and the Diedrich (French Roast)flavor is absolutely the best in my opinion.
B0007IQQVC1227139200 neutro Weak, Weak, Weak... I'm a strong coffee drinker and thought to myself that a French Roast is a bold coffee. Well, I didn't find this to be very "bold" so I can't rate it well according to my taste for coffee.If you like strong coffee like we do - consider these:1. Timothy's Midnight Magic --> BY FAR my favorite!2. Green Mountain Dark Magic3. Emeril's Extra BoldThat being said, some people don't like the strong taste of coffee so take my advice only if you are a strong coffee drinker.
B0007IQQVC1360713600 positivo Awesome Best french roast we have found for Keurig, strong and mellow. My husband is a coffee snob (we have 4 different coffee pots) and he drank all of my Keurig pods..
B0007IQQVC1357084800 neutro Produces watered down cup of coffee The flavor is good but the cup of coffee tastes watered down, much like the Columbian roast and I was hoping to avoid that by getting French Roast.
B0007IQQVC1287100800 positivo Strong and smooth I found this to be a pleasantly strong dark coffee; it was rich and smooth without being at all bitter. However, as I tend to prefer my coffee on the milder side, I am not sure that this would appeal to TRUE dark coffee lovers--i.e., what was good for me might not be right for someone looking for something stronger. Overall, however, I would recommend this coffee.
B0007IQQVC1257206400 positivo K-Cups RULE and so does this Product I am happy with my purchases of K-Cups from Amazon. They carry a few, but hopefully will carry more, as time passes. Thanks!
B0007IQQVC1202774400 positivo Rich and flavorful French Roast I have to agree, I have tried a number of other brands and the Diedrich French Roast is richer and more flaorful. The others have tasted thin. Almost a completely different machine with this French Roast. I have no idea why, buy it is worth trying.
B0007IQQVC1138492800 positivo Our favorite K-cup coffee so far. We have had a Keurig in our office for just over a month, and have tried quite a few varieties of coffee K-cups. So far this is our favorite.
B0007IQQVM1336176000 negativo Terribly weak We love Hazlenut coffee, so we figured that the Gloria Jean version would be great. Boy, were we wrong...... This was the weakest coffee (really slightly tinted brown water) that we have ever tried. After the first K-cup, we tried, the coffee was so weak, I thought that I had done something wrong. And the coffee tasted like hot water. So I made a second cup and watched the coffee as it came out of the Keurig. The last half of the brew was just clear water..... Terrible.So I grabbed a Green Mountain K-Cup and shook it. I could hear the coffee moving around inside and felt the weight compared the Gloria Jean. No comparison, The Gloria Jean was as light as a feather.We packed up the rest of the box and sent it back. I don't know what to make of this. Maybe we got a bad batch.
B0007IQQVM1301270400 positivo Excellent!!!!!!! Best coffee I have had in a long time. Hazelnut is my favorite and just ordered some mudslide and swiss almond chocolate...........
B0007IQQVM1357171200 positivo A good cup of coffee after we doctored it up a little! This is a good hazelnut coffee with just the right strength for my wife and me. We brewed a medium cup of coffee on the Keurig and the flavor was perfect after we doctored it up with our sweetener and a little cream. It was a medium strength cup of coffee with a hint of hazelnut in the flavor.Without being sweetened and without the cream it was rather harsh, strong and had an aftertaste. It would depend on how you like to prepare your coffee. I couldn't drink it straight but it was more than acceptable after we prepared it. It is a good cup of coffee and if you like hazelnut then you will like this.I posted a photo of the K-Cup.
B0007IQQWQ1124323200 positivo Really Good Coffee I really enjoy this coffee. I think it has great taste for being decaf. I will definatley buy this again.
B0007IQQWQ1333324800 negativo Shipping? I can't believe I was so stupid! Where was my head when I ordered three boxes of K-Cups, and agreed to $15.00 for shipping? I will never do that again! I'm definately going to pay more attention from now on! And I'll never order from "Stay at home Mom" again.I know I like the coffee, but I can get the same deal at full retail locally.
B0007IQQWQ1349395200 positivo Decaffeinated?? You would never know this was a decaffeinated coffee unless you read the label.This is a full bodied coffee without a trace of bitterness. The only satisfying decaf I've found.
B0007IQQWQ1282003200 positivo Good Tasting Decaf Coffee - Recommended! Timothy's "Colombian Decaffeinated K-Cups" is very good tasting coffee. I like coffee all day long, but need to switch to decaf later in the day. This is a good substitute for my normal type,Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging], but not quite as strong tasting.My only observation is that you can get two uses out of these K-Cups if made on the "Small Cup" setting, which serves us just fine since we add a lot of "Half and Half" to our evening coffee.Recommended!CFH
B0007IQQWQ1359072000 positivo Bought for the office I don't drink decaf, but I bought this for the office and my boss seems to like it. As long as the boss is happy....
B0007IQQWQ1356998400 positivo An excellent cup of coffee that you will not think is decaf! For several years now my wife and I have been drinking decaffeinated coffee. As we got older we need to cut back on caffeine as it began to make us jittery and have a few heart flutters. We found that it was hard to find a really good decaf coffee and many of them have a strange taste or a bitter taste.We were given a Keurig brewer for Christmas as a gift and I have to tell you that this coffee is just excellent. This is really a full bodied and rich coffee that I honestly cannot tell that it is decaf. There is no funny aftertaste or bitterness and my wife and I just love it. We brew the middle sized cup and the flavor was just perfect for us with a full flavor and not too strong.We both recommend it and we certainly will continue to use their coffee as one of our favorites.
B0007IQQWQ1340323200 neutro It's COLOMBIAN, not columbian... How do you expect to get to someone's liking if you do not even know how to spell their name, it is COLOMBIAN, not columbian (unless it is from Columbia, NY) :)...
B0007IQQWQ1282435200 positivo Best decaf I have tried... This is my "go to" decaf. Does that mean that I have to sacrifice flavor to lose the stimulant? Not in my opinion. This coffee tastes just a good as regular. It is one of those "not too strong, not too weak" blends that still has a distinct but subtle flavor.
