B000EVS4TY1206576000 positivo Delicious cookie mix I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix. I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix.
B0000DF3IX1127088000 positivo Sweet Paprika: A sweet ingredient! While in Hungary we were given a recipe for Hungarian Goulash. It needs sweet paprika. This was terrific in that dish and others. I will purchase it again when I need more.
B0002QF1LK1138147200 positivo Best Cereal BY FAR Without a doubt, I would recommend this wholesome and sweet cereal treat to anyone. The crunchy o-shaped pieces are filled with crispy rice, graham cracker bits, and infused with delicious honey flavor. "Oh! What a great cereal!"
B0002QF1LK1118016000 positivo Oh! This cereal is so sweet....yet so good for you! One taste=ADDICTION!!!! I just tried this cereal out of curiousity and I was hooked! It is an excellent breakfast choice, or just any time to eat! Especially as breakfast because you will crave more honey taste and you won't be hungry later {probably because of how much you'd eat} and it is actually sweeter and better than Honey Bunches of Oats. Cap'n Crunch Berries is an option, but this splendid cereal is SO FILLED WITH A HONEY-FILLED TASTE! I have not tried much better tasting cereal than this! Oh!
B0002QF1LK1206489600 neutro Oh's what a cereal! (^_^) ...Oh's what a price (O_o) Man I love Oh's cereal. It is really great to the last bite, but the size of the box its so small compared to all the other cereals out there. The price is crazy for such a small box...but oh's is one of the best cereals I have ever ever eaten. It keeps me coming back despite the small box, and crazy price. If you never had it you should try it just once. It is wonderful I give it 3 stars only because of the price and how much food you get. If the portions were more fair even for this price it would be five star gold...
B0002QF1LK1177545600 positivo ITS GOTTA BE THE BEST CEREAL OF ALL TIME And I've tried alot of cereals. This is by far the best.Its like the cereals I used to eat in the 80's, so sweet, yet so filling.I used to slam this cereal before I tried it.Now I'm hooked.
B0002QF1LK1154390400 positivo Yummmmm Oh's has been my favorite cereal as a kid and still is an essential staple of my college diet. It's absolutely f'ing delicious.
B0002QF1LK1215302400 neutro Delicious and Addictive This cereal is great because it tastes so good. You just crave it. But a word of warning: read the label. Last time my husband and I looked, it had saturated fat! All the other cereals in our cabinet did not... hmmmm. Another reviewer noticed this problem too!Also, Amazon's price of $23 is outrageous. It is between $1.99 to $2.50 in our stores.
B0002QF1LK1355961600 positivo Awesome Cereal I have look all over my hometown and no one carries this brand except Walmart (when they have it)...It tastes like Captain Crunch But is made by Quaker Oats and is exceptionally healthy for you.So I get the best of both worlds...Sweet and Crunchy as well as the Healthy aspect of it and not the pure sugar type...Bigger boxes would be nice though. My family has gone though 3 boxes in a matter of 1 week...Keep them coming...Thanks
B0002QF1LK1350691200 positivo 4 of 5 Oh yes. This cereal is delicious. It's O-shaped corn pieces with "good things in the middle", like real oatmeal. This is a Quaker product, after all. The caramel-like taste, which I'd compare to Cap'n Crunch or old school Mr T, Gremlins and Batman cereal, is sweetened with honey, graham (cracker) flour and brown sugar.It's not a good-tasting but a great-tasting cereal, easily one of the best I've ever tried. But; get this; it's too crunchy. No, it wont get soggy in milk, at-least not in any reasonable amount of time, but that's the problem because it makes for a hard chew. If it had the texture and consistency of, say, Cheerios, it'd be perfect.marcellee.com
B0002QF1LK1327795200 positivo Oh where Oh where have my Oh's gone? I was really distraught to go to my local Walmart and see that they stopped carrying my favorite cereal. But as was elated to find that "the site who has everything including a church" made it available to me by the 6-pack. Oh's is an amazing cereal. The one thing i dont like is the box is so small. I get maybe 3 bowls out of the entire box:-(.
B0002QF1LK1235260800 positivo Like fruit loops but much sweeter I tried these on a whim several weeks ago to offset the amount of chocolate I had eaten that week. It was nice and sweet for a few weeks with that first box. But then I tried it again this week and the aftertaste was so strong. The overall texture and layout of each piece is like Fruit Loops but with tons of honey add and less fruit or frosting. One box should be more than enough.
B0002QF1LK1181606400 neutro Yummy This cereal is awesome- but why is it $23, I just bought it at the store for 1.99!?
B0002QF1LK1184112000 positivo Things you must understand about OH's The 5 stars is based on 1)the taste which is amazing and 2) the price which is $1.99.HOWEVER there is much to dislike in OH's. They are NOT healthy, in fact they are the only cereal I've seen made with hydrogenated vegetable oil which is basically margarine. The lard will coat your spoon and roof of your mouth and probably arteries with a white oily film that does not rinse off with water alone. It must be diluted in soap and scrubbed.It is captain crunch shaped in a ring with bits in the middle and somehow sweeter and rougher on your mouth. Oh's virgins WILL have bloody pallates if not careful.
B0000DF3IZ1281312000 positivo Delicious. Adds a fantastic flavor to your cooking. It was fresh when it arrived and affordable.
B0000DF3IZ1174521600 positivo Thanks! It's great to have this spice that I can't find in stores around here - fast delivery and a good price.
B000BRWIBQ1168732800 neutro on order I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait.
B0005ZWCNS1185926400 neutro If it's good enough for Popeye... I always keeps a can of this fine product on me person. You never knows when some palooka wot ain't on the up and square is gonna need to be put in his place. It always leaves ya strong to the finish.
B000PKFZDM1326672000 positivo Thrilled I chose Omaha Steaks Fantastic. I sent it to my mother and her husband for Christmas. They just loved it. If your ever stuck for a gift Omaha Steaks is a great place to look for one.
B0000TU6PA1171065600 positivo You will not find a better tasting butter The Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with the most expensive French butter. I actually prefer Lurpak over expensive brands like Beurre d'Echire, Celes-sur-Belle, or Isigny-Ste-Mere.Lurpak is a true lactic, or cultured, butter, and it is full of flavor. Therefore a warning is in order: once you start using this stuff there is no going back. Land O'Lakes simply will not do anymore and you will be stuck searching for this stuff wherever you go from then on.
B0000TU6PA1288051200 neutro I like kellygold butter better I guess with any cheese or dairy product, different people are going to have different tastes. This butter is slightly closer to tasting like cheese (although it does not taste like cheese) than kellygold butter, imo. Maybe that's why I like kellygold better. Because I don't like the taste of cheese.I'm sort of glad I got this butter to at least compare with kellygold though. I think it is more easily spreadable, and maybe a tad bit "softer" butter than kellygold.Maybe I'll just try ordinary organic american made butter next time.. it's a whole lot cheaper, and see how it compares with premium butters.
B0000TU6PA1197590400 positivo Fantastic Lurpak is far better than any other butter out there. Be glad you can buy it in the USA! Creamy, tasty and just plain good.
B0000TU6PA1277078400 neutro you're cooking with Butter Recently (I think it was their cookie show) ATK voted Lurpak as the #1 butter in their tasting. And unlike Rach Ray who doesn't think twice about recommending the most ludicrous ingredients that cost the most, I have tremendous respect for Chris Kimball because he actually knows what he's talking about.The taste of Lurpak is very similar to Land O' Lakes, which IMO is truly the standard of butter. I have only tried it a few times since I do not have any recipes that call for butter, but I wanted to try Lurpak since it was so highly recommended. On a piece of toast it is fine and it melts very well.It comes in a little block and it is extremely firm (the sign of all fine butter).I am not certain if I will purchase this again since I was not overly impressed with Lurpak and because Land O' Lakes comes packaged much nicer and is a lot less. Nevertheless, Lurpak is still a good butter to try and to use if you have any recipes that call for a high-fat content butter.Anyway I found this at Shop Rite (don't you dare buy this online unless you enjoy paying more than twice the price - it is stold at all grocery stores) for two ninety-nine for 8 ounces (which is the size of 2 Land O' Lakes sticks).Remember, you don't have to spend a lot to be a great cook.
B0000DF3J21281312000 positivo Delicious. Adds a fantastic flavor to your cooking. It was fresh when it arrived and affordable.
B0000DF3J21174521600 positivo Thanks! It's great to have this spice that I can't find in stores around here - fast delivery and a good price.
B0000TU6P01171065600 neutro Real cultured butter of high quality I usually buy the salted version of this butter since I mostly use it for spreading and for that I like the flavor of the salted version better. That being said, there are a number of recipies that call for unsalted butter and then the unsalted Lurpak is as good as you will find.Note that Lurpak is cultured butter (not sweet cream butter like most American brands) and as such it has a deep and rich flavor that no simple sweet cream butter can match. Cultured butter of this kind is produced by fermenting the cream with lactic bacteria that convert sugars to lactic acid before churning the cream into butter.In my opinion, the Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with far more expensive butters. I actually prefer Lurpak over brands like Echire, etc.
B0000TU6P01278115200 negativo Received melted I am sure this is delicious as it had been recommended to me.However, it was completely melted when I received it, thepackage did not state PERISHABLE and the postage was expensive.I would not buy from this particular site again.
B0000TU6P01351123200 positivo My former #1 butter........... ....to be replaced by Plugra.I became a 'butterholic' after tasting free sample of Lurpak at room temp spread on crakers at Wild Oats years ago.I had thought that butter was butter, and this premium stuff was just marketing gimmick, NOT!Ever since lurpak became my regular butter, I started 'testing' other premium butters, so far none ever surpassed lurpak till I tried Plugra at Whole Foods.Lurpak has this smooth, but tangy taste I crave for. It's an excellent butter to use on fancy Eurostyle bread with organic milk on mornings. But it's not a 'cooking' butter, yes one can use lurpak for cooking, but it's really a waste of flavor and such premium price to boot.Eventually I found another premium butter that replaced lurpak, Plugra, made in USA, and cheaper than lurpak, and even more complex and nuanced flavor than lurpak.Even Cook's illustrated declared Plugra a superior butter than lurpak, its former favorite just like it used to be mine.
B0000TU6P01141862400 neutro support denmark during middle eastern boycott Since the absurd boycott of Danish products in the Middle East over cartoons, it is good for the west and freedom to support Denmark. Their Lurpak butter and Arla cheeses are delicious and available on-line and at many grocery stores in the US. Buy, you'll like!
B0000DF3J01281312000 positivo Delicious. Adds a fantastic flavor to your cooking. It was fresh when it arrived and affordable.
B0000DF3J01174521600 positivo Thanks! It's great to have this spice that I can't find in stores around here - fast delivery and a good price.
B000HZIKZA1180656000 positivo Cashews are fresh While the cashews are fresh, they are on the lightly salted side. That makes them healthy for you, but my husband prefers more salt. However, Amazon recently ran these for around $4 a pound, including super saver shipping, which made them pretty irrestible.
B0002QF1NI1182816000 positivo I am so glad I found this! At one time this cereal was available in my local stores. However it was discontinued. I searched the internet and finally found "Quaker Oat Bran" here. The cereal is great it is crunchy and holds the crunchiness even after you add the milk. I love the flavor and it helps to control my cholesterol too.
B0002QF1NI1191196800 positivo light, tasty and healthy Great taste, although a higher in calories than some of the other cereals and good in Folic acid and heat healthy.Wonder why it is not available at the local grocery stores?
B0002QF1NI1169424000 positivo Best Cereal for the Entire Family I started eating Quaker Oat Bran 2 years ago because I wanted a cereal that is high in fiber and protein, yet low in sugar. It is so good as a cereal with milk, and it stays crunchy. It also makes a fantastic trail mix with almonds and dried cranberries or other dried fruit. It reminds me a little of Chex cereal or Life cereal, but it is much healthier and substantial. I have not found any cereal I like better. Now my kids love it, too. I can't keep enough of it in the house. And I prefer this cereal to Quaker Oats Squares, which are made of larger squares.
B0002QF1NI1264982400 neutro Wish I could get it locally The one supermarket chain in our area that carries Quaker Essentials Oat Bran cereal closed our local store. We can get it by driving around 60 miles round trip, but that is inconvenient and wasteful of gas.I could substitute another cereal for myself, but my peach-faced lovebird loves it, and so far will accept no substitute. She eats some, and dunks some in her water bowl, then piles it on a perch. The result is a "cereal sculpture." Why she does this, I don't know.I ordered it through an Amazon vendor and received excellent service, but I wish the shipping wasn't so darn expensive.
B000IG7NCY1350432000 negativo Could Easily break a tooth So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor.
B000CDI0PC1293062400 negativo Worth Buying Last time, my first experience with Lacas, I bought their Kenya. This time I tried their Columbian.This is a quality product for a fair price. Buying a five pound bag is a convenience, too. I only buy two of these in a year, and I never run out. Why make 50 trips a year to the grocery store to buy the teensy bag? The product arrives promptly and keeps very well. Hard to go wrong.
B0000DK2WM1093651200 positivo Fresh Asiago Is great! If you are looking for a flavorful substitute for mozzarella this is it. It has a bit of a bite, melts great and adds bunches of flavor in any application. I have sliced it and melted it on grilled chicken sandwiches, have shredded it and blended it with mozzarella and provolone for pizza, and used it in omelets - all with great results. This is a great tasting cheese - not very well known - which once you try you will be a fan of forever!
B000DZLEZW1359331200 positivo Great brand of mints I love this brand but the orange isn't my favorite flavor. I thought I'd give it a try but I wasn't in love.
B0000TU6RI1358380800 positivo Great Jam!! This is truly wonderful gooseberry jam. It is packed with chunks of gooseberries. I highly recommend this product!! It truly met my expectations.
B0000DK2XR1263081600 positivo A mild and lovely version of this cheese I hope Amazon reinstates this (though it is available at Costco, shopping from the computer chair is sooo convenient!); this is my very favorite gorgonzola. Milder than some, it keeps extremely well, and I even substitute it in dishes calling for Stilton... the best!
B000KNHK5K1176595200 neutro Zsweet This sweetener does not seem very sweet to me, but my husband will use it and he won't touch the blue, pink or yellow artificial sweeteners. I've used it in coffee and tea and baking and had pretty good results. I've mixed it with stevia as well. I don't detect any bitterness or soapiness, but it has a somewhat minty effect that is hard to describe. The mintiness is not really a flavor so much as a minty coolness. I find the yellow sweetener's flavor to be much more sugary than zsweet, but I wanted a sweetener that does not use maltodextrin as a filler.
B000KNHK5K1231977600 negativo Better than Stevia As a natural sweetener, this is far superior to Stevia. There's no bitter aftertaste, and when I use it in coffee and tea, it tastes like sugar. HOWEVER, I've baked with it and unlike its claims, it does cause "gastrointestinal distress" for me. Stick to using it in your drinks.Note: ZSweet also sells individual packets that are supposed to have a more intense sweetness. Don't get them. They don't taste like sugar.
B000KNHK5K1267142400 neutro I will stick with the pink or blue packets... Found this on sale and excitedly tried it this morning in my coffee and a fresh fruit and yogurt smoothie. I wasn't pleased with results in the smoothie because it didn't seem to dissolve properly, probably because of the cold. This resulted in my smoothie having a "sandy grit" texture but the taste was okay. It did dissolve properly in the hot coffee and tasted just fine.Maybe an hour or so later my tummy started gurgling and shortly after was my first of MANY mad dashes to the bathroom today. This started with the smoothie at about 8 AM and has continued throughout the day (it is now 4:15 PM). The info about the product states that it does not cause gastrointestinal distress but other reviews support my experience that it certainly does too AND it continues for long after the product has surely been flushed (pun intended) from your body.
B000KNHK5K1174348800 negativo Worse than Stevia. Mild sweeetness - though ultimately tastes like soap - or something reminiscent of soap.
B000CDI0QG1234137600 negativo Expensive 38.39 is a ridiculous price for 12 red bull. especially considering they cost 2.09 in a store.
B000CDI0QG1286323200 negativo Highway Robbery It always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly over-priced items on here. You can bet I'll never buy anything from this vendor, even if it is a great deal.This is a ridiculously high price for Red Bull. On sale in the stores one can find it for $1.50/can. Why would someone pay more than that online? Caveat emptor --- let the buyer beware!
B000HKLNDG1233878400 neutro Paper on "hand decorated" box looks cheap I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It may be "exotic" wood but the paper stuck to the wood is coming off the front left corner and greatly diminishes its beauty. The tea is nice but it's not worth the money, in my opinion. I knew the box wouldn't be hand painted but I thought the craftsman would've done a better job of gluing down the paper.
B000HKLNDG1262563200 neutro I'm glad I didn't pay for it. I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. ALL of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea. I avoid drinking caffein, which green tea contains, so I gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections. The chest is kind of cheap (paper glued over something, as described by another reviewer). It's pretty, but I don't expect it to hold up.
